&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-to-ride-hailing&#34;&gt;Introduction to Ride Hailing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Uber_taxi_in_Moscow.jpg/640px-Uber_taxi_in_Moscow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, it is pretty common to hail a ride to get from one place to the other at a tap of a button. Almost all major cities in the world have some sort of ride-hailing service. Uber, Lyft, Didi, Ola, Gojek, etc. are some examples of service providers that come to mind. Additionally, the service is also proliferating to smaller cities and has become commonplace in many parts of the world. Analytics is a key component in making sure the service is provided efficiently. All of the aforementioned companies invest heavily in data science and analytics to be competitive and to provide better services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the course project, I will focus on Ride-Hailing services (not Ride Sharing services). See the difference &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecolane.com/blog/ride-hailing-vs.-ride-sharing-the-key-difference-and-why-it-matters&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predominantly, ride-hailing functions as a &lt;em&gt;Gig Economy&lt;/em&gt;. The drivers (sometimes referred to as partners, captains, etc.) are mostly independent contractors who bring their own vehicle and work at their own time and are paid based on their time commitment. This variability requires monitoring, sophisticated algorithms, good incentives, competitive pricing to passengers, etc. which is also common in other gig economy jobs. In most cases, the analytics models that will be built for one gig economy can be tweaked to fit another one as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few components of Ride-hailing that will be relevant for how we frame our models and the data we use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the course project, &amp;ldquo;passengers&amp;rdquo; are referred to as service requesters/receivers and &amp;ldquo;drivers&amp;rdquo; are referred to as service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;components-of-the-problem&#34;&gt;Components of the problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;balancing-act-supply-and-demand-and-chicken-and-egg-problem&#34;&gt;Balancing act: Supply and Demand, and Chicken and Egg Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a balancing act that all of these ride-sharing platforms need to perform to be efficient. A healthy ratio between driver and passenger (to go more granular, for a segment of geographic area at a given time) is very important.  The balancing act is even crucial when a ride-hailing service decides to introduce itself to a new city (especially one that is new to ride-hailing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an area has more drivers than demand from passengers, the drivers might not get ride requests causing them to lose interest and find a different job or move to a different competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an area has more passengers than a supply of drivers, the passengers might not get their ride requests accepted causing them to move onto another (direct/indirect) competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an analytics perspective, this is a difficult problem to solve. However, good analytics can also be a competitive advantage here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pricing&#34;&gt;Pricing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pricing is a by-product of the balancing act described above. The pricing must be competitive enough to lure the supply and the demand pool. The driver should feel like the pricing justifies the time, effort, and resources supplied. The passenger should feel the amount paid for the service justifies the service received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few ride-hailing services opt-out for transparent and fixed payment (i.e the price is only dictated by the distance to destination), while some have complex pricing strategies to stand out, lure passengers or drivers, and manage supply and demand effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-pricing&#34;&gt;Dynamic Pricing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ride-hailing services implement dynamic pricing as a way to balance the chicken and egg problem described above. This is a large-scale, complex analytics problem involving several variables. Additionally, driver bonuses, discounts, and referrals might constitute the pricing strategy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;descriptive-analysis&#34;&gt;Descriptive analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we build complex models, it is essential to understand how the business/service is performing. These descriptive analyses will lay the foundation for us when we build complex and combined models later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ride-completioncancellation-rate&#34;&gt;Ride Completion/Cancellation rate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the ride completion rate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be more granular, what is the ride completion rate at a geographic segment of the city at a particular time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the ride cancellation rate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar to before, what is the ride cancellation rate at a geographic segment of the city at a particular time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do passengers cancel rides?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is cancellation more prominent in one area compared to the other?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this dependent on the time of the day?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passenger_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;driver_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;latitude (pickup, drop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;longitude (pickup, drop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamps (requested, accepted, picked up, dropped, canceled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;completion_status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cancellation_reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;late-arrival-rate&#34;&gt;Late arrival rate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the late arrival rate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the late arrival rate at a geographic segment of the city at a particular time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the late arrival rate prominent for some time of the day or for a particular geographical area?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passenger_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;driver_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;latitude (pickup, drop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;longitude (pickup, drop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamps (requested, accepted, picked up, dropped, canceled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;completion_status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cancellation_reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;activation-acquisition-retention-referral-revenue&#34;&gt;Activation, Acquisition, Retention, Referral, Revenue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the pirate metric funnel look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a specific area where the business should focus to improve business/efficiency?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the funnel leaking somewhere?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the passenger/driver churn rate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passenger_id/driver_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamps (created_date, last_ride_date)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total_amount_spent_on_platform / total_money_made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total_rides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;num_of_referrals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acquisition_channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;channels&#34;&gt;Channels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the acquisition rate from different marketing channels for drivers or for passengers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What marketing channel is more apt/effective for different demography/user segments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we use the multi-arm bandits model to identify a balance between exploration and exploitation to test on different channels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passenger_id/driver_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamps (created_date)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acquisition_channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total_amount_spent_on_platform / total_money_made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passenger/driver demographic information (age, gender, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;user-analysis&#34;&gt;User Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the demography (social, cultural, economic) of the driver look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the demography (social, cultural, economic) of the passenger look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the demography of the city look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the demography of the segment that uses the service the most look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passenger_id/driver_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamps (created_date)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acquisition_channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total_amount_spent_on_platform / total_money_made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passenger/driver/city demographic information (age, gender etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;driver-rankingdriver-performance&#34;&gt;Driver Ranking/Driver Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is a driver performing? (this could be based on multiple factors including customer rating, and other factors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the index for performance, what is the rank of a driver?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the rank of a driver among a segment of drivers? (this will be useful for priority queue for driver dispatching)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;driver_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;average_rating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rides_complete_rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last_ride_date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;predictive-analysis&#34;&gt;Predictive analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are looking to make the system more efficient, it is also very important to understand what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;growth-in-rides&#34;&gt;Growth in rides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the number of expected daily rides next day/week/month/year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the expected revenue for the next day/week/month/year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a daily/weekly/monthly seasonality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamp (daily)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;num_of_ride (completed rides or ride requests)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;passenger-growth&#34;&gt;Passenger growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the number of expected passenger growth next day/week/month/year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a daily/weekly/monthly seasonality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamp (daily)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;num_of_unique_passengers (acquisition or ride request)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;driver-growth&#34;&gt;Driver growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the number of expected driver growth next day/week/month/year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a daily/weekly/monthly seasonality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamp (daily)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;num_of_unique_drivers (acquisition or ride request)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;churn-over-the-period-of-time&#34;&gt;Churn over the period of time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the expected churn in the next day/week/month/year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a daily/weekly/monthly seasonality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamp (passenger acquisition)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passenger&amp;rsquo;s number of rides each month (grouped acquisition to present)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prescriptive-analysis&#34;&gt;Prescriptive analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descriptive and Predictive analysis will help us move towards prescriptive analysis, especially for optimization models. These models will help the service provider in decision making, especially with regards to an increase in efficiency for drivers and passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ratio-of-drivers-to-passengers&#34;&gt;Ratio of drivers to passengers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-is-the-ideal-ratio-of-the-passenger-to-the-driver-to-maximize-rides-completion-rate&#34;&gt;What is the ideal ratio of the passenger to the driver to maximize rides completion rate?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voronoi clustering for geographic indexing based on geographic hotspots (other indexing methods are more efficient like h3 developed by Uber, but Voronoi can be used to build something similar as well. I wanted to use the topics covered in this class)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rides data (requested, canceled, completed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passenger data (raw data and data after descriptive analysis performed: Pirate metrics etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;driver data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimization
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with constraints: num_of_rides should be greater than a threshold (comes from future rides data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with objective functions: maximize rides completion rate for each geographic segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to find an optimal driver to passenger ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression (or logistic regression if we only care about a healthy/unhealthy ratio) can also be used to do something similar as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, the result from the model can also be used to model advertisement campaigns for the future if we find the number of driver or passenger (in a particular geographic area) need to be increased for a stable ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is an important indicator because it allows the service provider to focus on growth while keeping this indicator at a healthy level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-pricing-1&#34;&gt;Dynamic pricing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-should-the-dynamicsurge-pricing-be-at-a-given-time&#34;&gt;What should the dynamic/surge pricing be at a given time?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ratio of the driver to passenger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;paying capacity of passengers (based on descriptive analysis of users, useful for capping at some multiplier so that it does not go wild)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number of requests in the queue in a geographic segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;competition surge at the moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number of requests completed in the geographic segment (and neighboring segment) in last x minutes (arbitrary but can be defined by waiting for time analysis from descriptive analysis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geographic location information (grid-based on Voronoi for the availability of drivers in other cells)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number of drivers that will be free (complete a ride soon or are predicted to come online soon) in the grid or neighboring grids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear regression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to find ideal dynamic pricing multiplier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cap might/might not be necessary, and that might be another analytics problem altogether. There have been some cases where a natural disaster/terrorist attack increased surge multiplier to an exorbitant number causing massive backlash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grid above refers to one unit of Voronoi based geographic segmentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is necessary to study the correlation of some of the predictors mentioned above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ride-dispatching&#34;&gt;Ride Dispatching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-is-a-robust-ride-dispatching-mechanism-that-will-increase-passengers-and-drivers&#34;&gt;What is a robust ride dispatching mechanism that will increase passengers and drivers?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drivers in Geographic Grid (and neighboring Grid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driver Rating/Driver Ranking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geographic Grid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pickup/Drop location (distance and Grid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimization
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with constraints: the probability of each driver getting ride should be close to 1, waiting time should be less than some threshold for the request to be accepted  or not accepted (which comes from descriptive analysis), the time between request dispatching (time window a driver gets before the request is passed on to a different driver, also comes from descriptive analysis) should be equal to the acceptable waiting time divided by some constant (integer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with objective functions: maximize rides completion rate for each geographic segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Notes **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queuing models can also be here to identify correct values for the dispatching system (waiting time, dynamic geographic grid, etc.). However, there is a need to check the distribution of different events (booking created, booking accepted, waiting time, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems analytics is extremely relevant in all aspects of ride-hailing. In this project, I merely covered a few use cases, with one or two relevant models. Even with this brief exploration, I can conclude that analytics can lead to better outcomes for both drivers and passengers. In the article that was used as a reference for the course project, Didi looks into using analytics to solve some of the aforementioned problems. While there approch will be more sophisticated, the above models can also serve as a baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-brief-history-of-tootle&#34;&gt;A brief history of Tootle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PdO1BY4SST8/WP6x0XBJKPI/AAAAAAAAHqc/UaCecAEMDYoe4D414rhzbgupbpk4n5XDwCLcB/s320/change-copy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello World,
When Tootle started, there were four of us. At the time, we were working on EdCrayon (Three60’s Education and Classroom Management System). The development of EdCrayon was pretty much complete and one of the better schools in town had been implementing it for a year. We were busy with building fewer last minute requirements such as Nepalese school standard digital report cards and student ranking systems. After those were done and the academic session ended, we were preparing for the next academic session and we were also in talks with several schools for implementation of EdCrayon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://princihere.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/androiddevices.png?w=456&amp;amp;h=393&amp;amp;zoom=2&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://princihere.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/androiddevices.png?w=456&amp;amp;h=393&amp;amp;zoom=2&#34;&gt;https://princihere.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/androiddevices.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because of earthquake of 2015, the school that were lined up decided to back out and use their EdCrayon allocated resources on repairing the infrastructure damages. We would come to work and not feel productive at all. Due to the sheer boredom at work, we started researching on several ideas including location based services. One of the very first ideas was to create an app that would allow users to track location of Sajha buses on Google Maps so that they could plan on leaving offices/homes by referencing estimated time of arrival provided by the app. Even though Sajha buses were comparatively convenient, the problem was that people had to wait for the buses, generally up to half an hour,  since bus stops arrival timings were more or less random.  We developed the prototype for a Sajha bus route but since Sajha bus did not show any interest we decided to move on to other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LUNyxO3d1Do/V_SwqMqhWwI/AAAAAAAAFa4/koo69yvCxmkgOBKS4ilOyneOA94iMAQkQCLcB/s640/Screenshot_2016-01-26-07-23-09.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I was researching on asynchronous API calls for a pet project of mine. I had been trying to figure out the best way to sync client’s on-device offline database and off-device master database. In this process, one of the first things that I did was to look into creating my own implementation by syncing Android SQLite database with MySQL database. Up until this point, when ever client sync was required, I would simply clear out the content adapter’s list, remove all elements, get all elements from master server and refill the adapter. This allowed for easy implementation. However, even if nothing was changed in the client database, whenever the client hit the sync button or pulled to refresh, the process would get repeated. Basically the question I was trying to answer was,
“Is it faster and less expensive to individually assess for updates by comparing updated_date and id or to simply truncate and refill?” During the research for this, I stumbled upon newer technologies that would allow setting up changes listeners on client’s devices to refresh the changed list without having to trigger an action to sync the data. Using this finding and our research from location based services, we felt comfortable tackling the idea for a ride sharing application from a technological perspective, and Tootle was born.
Tootle was not Tootle from the very beginning. We continued our research on appropriate Business Models, Brand Positioning, Business Strategy, and Marketing and Delivery. Based on the changes in how we were going to position our brand in the market, we changed the product name from CabIO (digital cabs), KAR.ma (share your ride for karma), Bzuli (environmentally conscious ride sharing) and finally to Tootle (a fun way to travel without restricting the service to electric vehicles and only four wheeled vehicles). In the meantime, based on the Business Models and Brand Positioning, several elements of the app were also changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the concept of ride sharing is not new, and several companies such as Uber, Lyft, Ola and Go-Jek have implemented it tremendously well, Tootle is different mainly due to three core elements. First of all, we let our partners decide if they want to take a ride, i.e, we introduced the idea of casual Tootle partners. For example, a partner A can decide to give rides throughout the day and make this his/her full time job or simply give rides that matches his/her travel itinerary. The technology is adjusted in such a way that a tootle ride requests are sent to several partners within a vicinity rather than just one partner. Unlike aforementioned companies, there are no penalties involved for not taking a ride. Secondly, albeit not completely by choice, we have realized that frugality invites creativity. At every step of technology development, we have had to strategize inexpensive yet effective ways to solve problems. Although we are still purely in development phase as of today, I believe we can really take pride in what we have accomplished given the resources. This is also reflective in the product. We were forced to think about minimizing data consumption (given the high data cost in Nepal) and poor internet infrastructure. Currently, on average, a particular ride for a partner in terms of data exhausts 1 MB while him/her being able to log in, select appropriate ride, complete the ride and get paid, while the backend collects ride information such as timestamps for actions and exact route followed. This costs him/her 50 Paisa which is approximately $0.005. Finally, last but not the least, the major difference comes in the form of technology adaptation, contextualization and more importantly, communication. Kathmandu is traditionally more or less a close-knit community where people prefer talking to people to garner a sense of confirmation and safely. Therefore, it was crucial to build a simple and clean UI that gets the job done and focus massively on developing technologies that provided real time ride statistics to our team at call center so that they could assist people giving and taking Tootle rides. Similarly, since digitization of payment was essential but Nepal is not ready for secure and realtime credit card transaction, apart from local third party digital wallet integration we also have QR top-ups. To summarize, although from the surface, Tootle is a ride sharing application like Uber, it has established its own identity via contextualization of the requirements of Nepali needs. This is apparent throughout the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tootle Today&lt;/strong&gt;
From our experience, we have realized that market drives technology and not the other way around. We have also realized that although technology is merely a facilitator, it can do wonders to solve problems and invoke habit changes if done correctly.  Now, we have a multidisciplinary team of 15 striving to make Tootle technologies and services better each passing day with the goal of doing it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learnings from Tootle</title>
      <link>https://ayushsubedi.github.io/posts/tootle_learnings/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2017 13:12:41 +0545</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xoX-IvzEIrQ/WABs5p6To1I/AAAAAAAAFrs/IWVJmZ1RCtMsuxGVD9tBO_he__--YMo-QCLcB/s320/client%2Bcopy%2Bcopy.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tootle.today/&#34;&gt;Link to Tootle Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tootle is a ride sharing service that matches bike riders and commuters. While the concept is not new, there are several contextualization factors that makes it unique. As research and development engineer and lead software developer, this was my biggest challenge to date and I learnt a lot of things. However, since we worked in a very small team, I occasionally came across problems related to branding, client relationship, marketing and overall B2C business model. This blog post will dive into those learnings rather than focus on technological implementations. To summarize the entire post, it is about my journey from a single dimensional software developer to a software developer who also understands project management, human resources, market, competition, branding and plethora of other factors that a software developer whose long term goal is to become a tech entrepreneur needs in their arsenal.&lt;br&gt;
Start small, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rome.com&#34;&gt;www.rome.com&lt;/a&gt; was not built in a day
This is trivial for most people, but not for me. There were times I was so focused on completing a task that I lost the bigger picture. Breaking down a task into smaller subtasks and solving them as soundly as possible is the key. Also, when you push yourself too hard, you miss small details that might have huge consequences in the future. Think scalability while solving little problems. Like Will Smith said, &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t set out to build a wall. You don&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that&amp;rsquo;s ever been built.&amp;rsquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t start there. You say, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid. You do that every single day. And soon you have a wall.&amp;rdquo; Also, Hofstadter&amp;rsquo;s law will come along to shatter all your to-do plans for the day. It&amp;rsquo;s just the way it is. Deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lk7I4HamgPU/WACFovpy-MI/AAAAAAAAFr8/LpuH3ASDSr0wCiVsi0BonqIXJ8pNVJGRACLcB/s640/chicago-used-2__large.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development and design is an iterative, never ending process. It is not a sprint but a marathon.
Seeking perfectionism hurts. First of all, there is no perfect code or design. There might be something that looks, feels and works great today, but it is never going to be perfect. You will always have to come back to that line of code, redesign that slider that looked great once upon a time and continuously update based on user feedback. Coding is a little of writing code and a lot of maintaining it. You are never really done. Project preplanning and risk management might help with not having to go back to drawing board again and again, but development and design is very much an agile process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hire people who love what they do and love learning
Coworkers become your second family. During the course of Tootle development, I actually spent more time with my coworkers than my family.  Fortunately, everyone involved with Tootle are very passionate, hard-working and motivated people who never shy from learning. Also, certain characteristics such as being ardent, an embodiment and advocate of the product, and hardworking are more important than being skillful. I was also on the hiring team and I made sure to look for these characteristics. After all, Leicester City won 2015-2016 Barclays Premier League primarily because of their team spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MgSmVKnBG6E/WADATaZCg8I/AAAAAAAAFso/s7XZFY3qo8YEvTTLx849gULxVczPL2JBgCLcB/s640/IMG_20160803_034012.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prioritize what is important
There will be a lot of bugs. Code related stuff aside, there will also be several things that need attention. However, time is limited. At times you could be in front of your computer debugging for hours and hours, but still the issue tracker list and crash reporting list will be full. Therefore it is necessary to prioritize based on impact level. Assessing impact of a particular task can be difficult. However, if you have an awesome team, it is just a matter of discussing from a business and technical point of view. Also distinguishing between bugs, enhancement, improvement proposal and task is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R4umTfdBp5I/WADEcT34m5I/AAAAAAAAFs0/Spcrbd31xgwMAEOpzQUN_dpgqm0AM8DJQCLcB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-10-14%2Bat%2B5.25.10%2BPM.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication solves 95% of all problems
Communication is the key. Often during the day, talk to coworkers about the problems that you are having. First of all, when you explain the problem to someone, you understand the problem better yourself. Secondly, you are also in sync with what problems everyone else is facing. Similarly, simply talking about work related problems, expressing how you feel about deadlines, doing risk analysis together, discussing business strategy together, communicating dissatisfactions etc. will help solve a lot of problems earlier. So, constantly take a break, look outside the window, get a glass of water and simply talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress can be a catalyst if applied properly
This project was very much stressful. Retrospectively, it was supposed to be too because of its complexity. One of the things I really struggled with is handling stress. I have gotten better over the course of this project. However, I am still working on learning to change stress to a catalyst. I hope to become Arsene Wenger someday (giggles). However, I have learnt that if things don&amp;rsquo;t work tonight, you simply have to sleep over it. The freshness of morning solves a lot of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O_vPh17qjB0/WADQ7nuM8sI/AAAAAAAAFuI/NZ7piERzA-s2daUKxvRjAFdHk9deKo8HwCLcB/s640/IMG_20160916_181959.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NjOsMilsicA/WADPc4iPTnI/AAAAAAAAFuA/4MXAY_3LQYsvGloIusf9xTy7j1-ciliGQCLcB/s640/IMG_20160630_123334.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also just watch SRK dance in Hosh na khud kahi josh&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go running in the morning, be healthy
This one is self-explanatory. Run to remain stress free and healthy. I stopped running for a while because I was lazy. But, I was also lazy because I was not running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hqJRkJ3zMsc/WADVl2Az7OI/AAAAAAAAFv8/9rcEydolrfspR83o1PG7PM_cmBoxoHhEQCLcB/s640/IMG_20160505_062623.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition is good
While reading The Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman, I realized that having market competition is actually advantageous. This concept was really counterintuitive to me previously. Competition is good because it implies higher probability of fulfillment of something known as the Iron Law of Market. It basically means that like you, other people have also seen the availability of the market you are targeting. Similarly, there is a lot to learn from your competition. Learning and applying the principles of game theory helps a lot too.
Awesome tech implementation is second to client&amp;rsquo;s requirement
You could spend weeks and months on awesome, flawless and amazing features that your clients don&amp;rsquo;t really care about or half an hour on simple features that makes all the difference to them. For example, adding a bitcoin as payment system would be cool, but allowing a female client to select a female driver makes the product secure and also adds marketing and advertising weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fxSXJWd4UB8/WADoBxzEHWI/AAAAAAAAFwo/sdGRY963BeI7n1JlhALZLyFUsgngI8FNACLcB/s320/opengraph.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta tests are really really really important
You could sit hours upon hours, days upon days trying to find and fix all the problems. But, finding problems is more difficult once you know your product inside out. You are in a controlled office environment with fast internet, limited real test devices and a clear understanding of product workings. There is no way for you to find all the problems. The solution is to find real users to test, use and provide feedbacks. Canary tests and beta tests are therefore very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xKUeEk1hM9k/WADh-E7zfzI/AAAAAAAAFwU/Ud6JiIQ19jUvBahjniooj6PV1NPoLJFAwCLcB/s320/264d35bbe2af57848d1759f2c38381de.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you like it, does not mean users are going to like it also
You might absolutely love your product. However, it does not mean every user will like it also. Be prepared to get bad ratings. Also, they are not wrong to dislike something you adore so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous projects and keeping up to date with latest technologies help a lot
I really believe this one is a biggie. Regardless of whether or not a product succeeds, it is always a stepping stone for future products. This product would not have been possible or would have been terribly difficult without Edcrayon, Edquake, and dozens of other location related prototype. When prototyping, research on newer stacks and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LUNyxO3d1Do/V_SwqMqhWwI/AAAAAAAAFa4/koo69yvCxmkgOBKS4ilOyneOA94iMAQkQCLcB/s640/Screenshot_2016-01-26-07-23-09.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, revenue matters the most
In the words of Josh Kaufman,
Do not be a &lt;strong&gt;mercenary&lt;/strong&gt; since dedication in craft, patience to find right market to be dedicated towards and consistency is required to eventually make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, do not be a &lt;strong&gt;crusader&lt;/strong&gt; since you need money to pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish us good luck with our tootle journey.&lt;/p&gt;
