      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;journey-to-spam-detection&#34;&gt;Journey to Spam Detection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiralogics is hosting a first of it&amp;rsquo;s kind, AI Conference in Nepal this February - a platform for AI veterans and students to come together and network.
This year, Spiralogics is focused on exploring and explaining the ways how AI can create positive impact on different aspects of our life. It is a platform which will act as a driving force in encouraging the implementation of AI (especially in the Nepalese environment). Their purpose is to bring together professionals and students under one roof to rediscover the possibilities that AI can create in our day to day lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-was-i-involved&#34;&gt;How was I involved?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked to teach a 5 hour session to introduce the students to a concept of AI. I decided to conduct a workshop based session on Naive Bayes Classifier to detect spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;topics-covered&#34;&gt;Topics covered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probability Primer:&lt;/strong&gt; We look into some few probability problems and Monte Carlo Simulations to get a basic primer on probability and Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditional Probability&lt;/strong&gt;: We look into few examples on conditional probability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayes Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt; We connect Conditional Probability with Bayes Theorem.  We move from what we know to what we can infer and connect the dots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitivity, Specificity and Confusion matrix:&lt;/strong&gt; We look into concepts of Sensitivity, Specificity, TP, TN, FP and FN. We also look into Type I and Type II errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accuracy, Precision and Recall:&lt;/strong&gt; We look into different ways to evaluate our models and realize when one is more important than the other. We also study F1 score which combines Precision and Recall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naive Bayes:&lt;/strong&gt; We move from Bayes Theorem to Naive Bayes and define what Naive means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB Spam detection classifier&lt;/strong&gt;: We build a binary classifier using Scikit learn and publicly available SMS datasets. We also evaluate our model’s performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB vs Bagging, Random Forest and Adaboost&lt;/strong&gt;: We will not spend much time here. This notebook basically compares Naive bayes with other algorithmns for the same dataset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Solveathon Nepal 2019</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-solve-a-thon&#34;&gt;What is a Solve-a-thon?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataliteracy.github.io/images/main_feature.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;solveathon_feature&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-day Solveathon, the first of its kind, was organized by the World Bank and The Asia Foundation with support from UKAID at the Kathmandu University School of Management on 14-15 December. The event brought together data scientists, programmers, developers, researchers, and professionals with diverse backgrounds and provided them a platform to work collaboratively on data-driven projects to tackle developmental challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the event, the participating teams worked with mentors and respective domain experts to come up with solutions, refine them and devise various prototypes. The participants worked on nine different projects – three culminated from the 100-hour Nepal Data Literacy Program organized by the World Bank, three proposed by the participants, and three selected by the team based on the pertinent developmental issues and availability of data. The Solveathon will award a total amount of 10,000 USD, divided among two to five projects, to further develop their prototypes. In this phase, the awardees will assess and validate the feasibility of proposed prototype– assumptions in the theory of change, analyze user needs, develop sustainability and action plan–, identify potential partners, and analyze whether similar projects are existent or being planned in the market. Implementation and Review Phase: Under this phase, the awardees will implement their idea or prototype, evaluate its success and demonstrate plans for sustainability of impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was part of the planning and execution committee, and a technical mentor to the participating team. Additionally, once the projects were submitted, I also was part of the team that judged the team based on various criteria such as complexity, sustainability, cost and team members. Three of the projects from the event have started taking good shape at the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also responsible for creating the event website which you can find &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataliteracy.github.io/solveathon/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>British College AI Conference</title>
      <link>https://ayushsubedi.github.io/posts/british_ai_conference/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;nepal-students-and-ai&#34;&gt;Nepal, students and AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference titled “Artificial Intelligence for Transforming Business and Society (AITB2019)”, brought together more than 100 international and national academics, industry experts, researchers, policy makers and students under one roof to share their research findings, experience, and expertise in the field of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the AITB2019 Organizing Committee, the topic of Artificial Intelligence(AI) was chosen to discuss the relevance of AI revolution happening all over the world and in the context of Nepal. It was also intended to bring the national and international intellect to share their ideas through their research and experience in the field of AI. The initiation of discussion about the importance for Nepal to keep up with the AI revolution and to make sure that the human resources are prepared for the future skills was the main aim of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion-topics&#34;&gt;Discussion Topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was one of the panelist and we were asked the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of the impact of AI, how big do you think the impact will be in our lives in the future? You are free to choose your timelines here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How important is it to be updated about AI today? Why does everyone need to know about AI?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we inspire the young generation to be part of the AI revolution? or is it the other way around? (ie. do we need to inspire the older generation, policymakers to be part of the revolution to make the progress faster?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the academic perspective, do you see a need to do something radically different on how we impart knowledge now vs when AI will be prevalent?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a debate about jobs when AI will really come in effect? What is your stand in this debate? will there be more jobs or fewer jobs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final question, do we need to fear AI? will we be taken over by machines? or will we all be cyborgs that will be completely in sync with the machines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ayushsubedi.github.io/img/british_ai.png&#34; alt=&#34;Panelists&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release for the program concluded the following regarding our panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The second panel moderated by Mr. Amod Niroula, Co-founder and Project Manager at ACT360, brought industry practitioners, entrepreneurs and academics together to discuss the need for developing AI strategies for tomorrow. Panelist Dr Bal Krishna Bal, Head of Department, Computer Science at Kathmandu University emphasized the crucial role of academia in providing the needed talent as well as the need for adaptation and updating of curriculum. Mr. Ayush Subedi, Co-founder/CTO of Moonlit Solutions stressed the need to first increase access to disaggregated data to be able to adopt AI. Mr. Ravi Bajracharya, Co- founder of Wiseyak shared his own experiences about adopting AI in the field of healthcare for increased access to rural Nepal. Chief Technology Architect of Makura Creations, Mr. Chandan Gupta shared his views about not taking the AI revolution as a threat to jobs but instead a need to be aware of the changing nature of jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;
