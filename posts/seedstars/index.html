<h2 id="finding-answers-after-tootle">Finding answers after Tootle</h2>
<p>In 2017, I went to Thailand to participate in the Seedstars summit. The platform provides funding to startups in emerging markets. The diversity of project ideas made me curious enough to scrape data from the Seedstars website. After leaving Tootle, I was interested in researching the NEXT product to invest my time in. The data scraped would allow me to create a one stop place for every startup that had applied to Seedstars (there were plenty).</p>
