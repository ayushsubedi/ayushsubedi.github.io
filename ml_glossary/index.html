<h2 id="basic-machine-learning">Basic Machine Learning</h2>
<h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of machine learning, an algorithm is a set of instructions that a computer follows in order to learn from data.</li>
<li>Machine learning algorithms take input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output value within an acceptable range.</li>
<li>The goal of a machine learning algorithm is to improve its prediction accuracy over time by adjusting the parameters of the model based on the input data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="change-detection">Change detection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Change detection is a process in which a system is able to identify changes in a given environment over time.</li>
<li>In the context of machine learning, change detection involves using algorithms to analyze data from a given environment in order to identify any changes that have occurred.</li>
<li>This can be useful in a variety of different applications, including monitoring changes in financial markets, detecting changes in customer behavior, or identifying changes in the physical environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="classification">Classification</h3>
<ul>
<li>Classification is a supervised learning problem in which the model is trained to predict a discrete label or class for a given input data.</li>
<li>The goal is to predict the class or category that a new instance belongs to, based on the training data.</li>
<li>For example, a classifier could be trained to predict whether an email is spam or not spam, based on the contents of the email. The input data would be the contents of the email, and the output class would be either &ldquo;spam&rdquo; or &ldquo;not spam&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There are many different algorithms that can be used for classification, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and decision trees. The choice of algorithm depends on the characteristics of the data and the desired complexity of the model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="classifier">Classifier</h3>
<ul>
<li>A classifier is a machine learning model that is trained to predict a discrete class or category for a given input data. Classifiers are used in a variety of applications, including spam filtering, image classification, and natural language processing.</li>
<li>There are many different types of classifiers, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and decision trees. The choice of classifier depends on the characteristics of the data and the desired complexity of the model.</li>
<li>To train a classifier, the model is presented with a labeled dataset that includes input data and the corresponding correct class or category. The model then &ldquo;learns&rdquo; to predict the correct class by finding patterns in the training data. Once trained, the classifier can then be used to predict the class for new, unseen data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cluster">Cluster</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of machine learning, a cluster refers to a group of data points that are similar to one another. Clustering is an unsupervised learning problem in which the goal is to divide the data into distinct groups, or clusters, such that the data points within each cluster are more similar to one another than they are to data points in other clusters.</li>
<li>There are many different algorithms that can be used for clustering, including k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. The choice of algorithm depends on the characteristics of the data and the desired properties of the clusters.</li>
<li>Clustering can be used for a variety of purposes, including data compression, anomaly detection, and generating hypotheses for further testing. It is a useful tool for exploring and understanding the structure of a dataset.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cluster-center">Cluster center</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of clustering, a cluster center is a representative data point for a cluster. It is typically the mean or median of the points in the cluster, depending on the specific clustering algorithm being used.</li>
<li>In k-means clustering, for example, the cluster center is the mean of all the data points in the cluster. The k-means algorithm works by iteratively assigning each data point to the cluster with the closest cluster center and then updating the cluster center to be the mean of the points in the cluster.</li>
<li>In hierarchical clustering, the cluster center can be thought of as the point at the center of the cluster, which is determined by the specific linkage criterion being used.</li>
<li>The cluster center is used to represent the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; data point in a cluster, and can be useful for understanding the characteristics of the cluster and for visualization purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clustering">Clustering</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clustering is an unsupervised learning problem in which the goal is to divide a dataset into distinct groups, or clusters, such that the data points within each cluster are more similar to one another than they are to data points in other clusters. Clustering is a useful tool for exploring and understanding the structure of a dataset, and can be used for a variety of purposes, including data compression, anomaly detection, and generating hypotheses for further testing.</li>
<li>There are many different algorithms that can be used for clustering, including k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering. The choice of algorithm depends on the characteristics of the data and the desired properties of the clusters.</li>
<li>In k-means clustering, for example, the goal is to partition the data into a specified number (k) of clusters by iteratively assigning each data point to the cluster with the closest cluster center and then updating the cluster center to be the mean of the points in the cluster. Hierarchical clustering, on the other hand, involves creating a hierarchy of clusters, where at each step, the two closest clusters are merged together. Density-based clustering algorithms, such as DBSCAN, identify clusters as areas of higher density surrounded by areas of lower density.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cusum">CUSUM</h3>
<ul>
<li>CUSUM is an acronym for &ldquo;Cumulative Sum.&rdquo; It is a statistical algorithm that is used to detect small shifts in the mean of a process over time. It is often used in quality control and reliability engineering to monitor processes and detect changes that may indicate a problem or deviation from the norm.</li>
<li>The CUSUM algorithm works by keeping track of a running total of the difference between the observed values and the expected or target value. When the running total exceeds a pre-determined threshold, it indicates that the process has shifted and may need to be corrected or investigated.</li>
<li>CUSUM charts are often used to visualize the performance of the CUSUM algorithm, with the running total being plotted on the y-axis and the time steps on the x-axis. The chart can then be used to identify when the running total exceeds the threshold and to identify any trends or patterns in the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deep-learning">Deep learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain, specifically the neural networks that make up the brain. It involves the use of artificial neural networks, which are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the brain, to learn from data and make decisions.</li>
<li>Deep learning algorithms learn by example, just like humans do. They learn by being presented with a large amount of labeled data and adjusting the internal parameters of the network to optimize performance on a specific task. The &ldquo;deep&rdquo; in deep learning refers to the fact that these algorithms typically have multiple layers of artificial neurons, with each layer learning to extract higher-level features of the data.</li>
<li>Deep learning has been successful in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. It has revolutionized the field of machine learning and has enabled the development of many practical applications that were previously thought to be impossible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dimension">Dimension</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of machine learning, a dimension refers to a particular feature or attribute of a dataset. For example, if you are working with a dataset that includes information about houses (such as price, number of bedrooms, square footage, and location), each of these features would be considered a separate dimension.</li>
<li>The number of dimensions in a dataset is often referred to as the &ldquo;dimensionality&rdquo; of the dataset. High-dimensional datasets, which have a large number of dimensions, can be difficult to work with and visualize, as it can be challenging to represent the relationships between all of the dimensions in a meaningful way.</li>
<li>In machine learning, techniques such as dimensionality reduction can be used to reduce the number of dimensions in a dataset, while still preserving the important information. This can be useful for tasks such as visualization and training machine learning models, which may be more efficient and effective on lower-dimensional data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="em-algorithm-expectation-maximization-algorithm">EM algorithm (Expectation-Maximization algorithm)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The EM algorithm (Expectation-Maximization algorithm) is a widely used method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model when there is missing or incomplete data. It is an iterative algorithm that alternates between two steps: the expectation (E) step and the maximization (M) step.</li>
<li>In the E step, the algorithm estimates the expected value of the complete data likelihood function (a measure of the probability of the data given the model parameters) based on the current parameter values. In the M step, the algorithm updates the parameter values to maximize the expected complete data likelihood. The process is then repeated until convergence, at which point the parameter estimates are considered to be optimal.</li>
<li>The EM algorithm is widely used in a variety of applications, including machine learning, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. It is particularly useful when the data are incomplete or when the model is a mixture model (i.e., a model that consists of a mixture of different underlying distributions).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heuristic">Heuristic</h3>
<ul>
<li>In machine learning, a heuristic is a simplified, approximate solution to a problem that is used to quickly find a satisfactory answer. It is often used in situations where finding the optimal solution is computationally infeasible or impractical.</li>
<li>Heuristics are often used in machine learning as a way to quickly search through a large space of possible solutions and find a good, but not necessarily optimal, solution. They can be useful for tasks such as optimization, feature selection, and model selection.</li>
<li>Heuristics are often designed to be domain-specific and are based on the specific characteristics of the problem at hand. They can be useful for providing a rough estimate or approximation of the solution, but they may not always be reliable or accurate. In general, heuristics should be used with caution and should be validated against more rigorous methods where possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="𝑘-means-algorithm">𝑘-means algorithm</h3>
<ul>
<li>The k-means algorithm is a method for clustering data into a specified number (k) of distinct clusters. It is an iterative algorithm that works by first randomly initializing k cluster centers, and then iteratively assigning each data point to the cluster with the closest cluster center and updating the cluster center to be the mean of the points in the cluster.</li>
<li>The k-means algorithm has the following steps:
<ul>
<li>Initialize k cluster centers randomly.</li>
<li>Assign each data point to the cluster with the closest cluster center.</li>
<li>Update the cluster centers to be the mean of the points in the cluster.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the cluster assignments stop changing or a maximum number of iterations is reached.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The k-means algorithm is sensitive to the initial cluster assignments, so it is common to run the algorithm multiple times with different random initializations to ensure that the final clusters are stable. The algorithm is also sensitive to outliers and may produce suboptimal clusters if the data contain outliers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="𝑘-nearest-neighbor-knn">𝑘-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a method for classifying objects based on the closest training examples in the feature space. It is a non-parametric method, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.</li>
<li>The KNN algorithm works by calculating the distance between the new data point and all the training data, and then selecting the k training points that are closest to the new data point. The class label of the new data point is then determined by majority vote among the k nearest neighbors.</li>
<li>The value of k is a hyperparameter of the KNN algorithm and must be chosen by the practitioner. A larger value of k will make the model more robust to noise, but a smaller value may be more sensitive to the underlying structure of the data.</li>
<li>KNN is a simple and effective method for classification, but it can be computationally expensive for large datasets, as it requires calculating the distance between the new data point and all the training examples.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kernel">Kernel</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of machine learning, a kernel is a function that takes in two inputs and returns a scalar value. Kernels are used in a variety of machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines (SVMs) and kernel principal component analysis (PCA).</li>
<li>In SVMs, kernels are used to define a similarity measure between two data points. The kernel function is applied to the data points to transform them into a higher-dimensional space, where it is then possible to find a linear separation between the classes. By using a kernel function, it is possible to learn a non-linear decision boundary in the original feature space using a linear classifier in the transformed space.</li>
<li>In kernel PCA, kernels are used to define a similarity measure between data points in the original space, and the resulting kernel matrix is used to perform PCA in the feature space. This allows for non-linear dimensionality reduction, which can be useful for data that is not linearly separable.</li>
<li>There are many different kernel functions that can be used, including linear kernels, polynomial kernels, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The choice of kernel depends on the characteristics of the data and the desired properties of the model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="margin">Margin</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of machine learning, the margin is the distance between the decision boundary (i.e., the line or hyperplane that separates the classes) and the nearest training data points. The margin is an important concept in certain types of algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs), where the goal is to find the decision boundary that has the largest margin.</li>
<li>In SVMs, the margin is the distance between the decision boundary and the closest data points from each class. The margin is maximized when the decision boundary is as far as possible from the closest data points from each class, which leads to a model that is more robust and generalizable to new data.</li>
<li>The margin can also be thought of as a measure of the confidence of the classifier. A larger margin indicates that the classifier is more confident in its predictions, as it is based on a wider separation between the classes.</li>
<li>The margin is an important consideration when training a machine learning model, as a model with a large margin is often preferred to a model with a small margin, as it is likely to be more robust and generalizable to new data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="machine-learning">Machine learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that involves the use of computational models to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the development of algorithms that can automatically improve their performance through experience.</li>
<li>There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</li>
<li>In supervised learning, the goal is to learn a function that maps input data to output labels, based on a labeled training dataset. The model is trained on the training data and then evaluated on a separate test dataset to evaluate its performance. Examples of supervised learning tasks include classification and regression.</li>
<li>In unsupervised learning, the goal is to discover patterns or relationships in the data without any prior knowledge or labeled training data. Examples of unsupervised learning tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.</li>
<li>In reinforcement learning, the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes a reward signal. The model is trained by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. Reinforcement learning is used in a variety of applications, including robotics and control systems.</li>
<li>Machine learning has been successful in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. It has revolutionized many fields and has enabled the development of practical applications that were previously thought to be impossible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="neural-network">Neural network</h3>
<ul>
<li>A neural network is a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the brain. It is composed of layers of interconnected &ldquo;neurons,&rdquo; which process and transmit information. Neural networks are able to learn and adapt to new data by adjusting the strengths of the connections between neurons.</li>
<li>The basic building block of a neural network is the neuron, which is a simple computational unit that receives input, processes it, and produces an output. The input is passed through multiple layers of neurons, with each layer learning to extract higher-level features of the data. The output of the final layer is the prediction or decision made by the neural network.</li>
<li>There are many different types of neural networks, including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The choice of neural network architecture depends on the characteristics of the data and the desired properties of the model.</li>
<li>Neural networks have been successful in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. They have revolutionized the field of machine learning and have enabled the development of many practical applications that were previously thought to be impossible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supervised-learning">Supervised learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct output is provided for each example in the training set. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a function that can map input data to the correct output labels.</li>
<li>Supervised learning algorithms can be divided into two main categories: regression and classification.</li>
<li>In regression, the goal is to predict a continuous value, such as the price of a house or the likelihood of a customer churning. Examples of regression algorithms include linear regression and support vector regression.</li>
<li>In classification, the goal is to predict a discrete label or class, such as whether an email is spam or not spam. Examples of classification algorithms include logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and decision trees.</li>
<li>Supervised learning is the most widely used type of machine learning and has been successful in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and fraud detection. It requires a labeled dataset to train the model, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support-vector-machine-svm">Support vector machine (SVM)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support vector machine (SVM) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression. It is based on the idea of finding a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates the classes.</li>
<li>In the case of classification, the goal is to find a hyperplane that separates the data points into different classes as well as possible. The SVM algorithm finds the hyperplane that has the largest margin, or distance, between the closest data points of each class. This maximizes the separation between the classes and leads to a more robust and generalizable model.</li>
<li>In the case of regression, the goal is to find a hyperplane that predicts the output value for a given input value. The SVM algorithm finds the hyperplane that minimizes the error between the predicted and actual values.</li>
<li>SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and are widely used in a variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. They are also robust to noise and can handle datasets with a large number of features. However, they can be computationally expensive to train and are not well-suited for very large datasets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the model is not given any labeled training data and must find patterns or relationships in the data on its own. The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover the underlying structure of the data, without any prior knowledge or assumptions.</li>
<li>Unsupervised learning algorithms can be divided into two main categories: clustering and dimensionality reduction.</li>
<li>In clustering, the goal is to group the data points into distinct clusters such that the points within each cluster are more similar to one another than they are to points in other clusters. Examples of clustering algorithms include k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.</li>
<li>In dimensionality reduction, the goal is to reduce the number of dimensions (features) in the data while preserving as much of the information as possible. This can be useful for tasks such as visualization and feature selection. Examples of dimensionality reduction algorithms include principal component analysis (PCA) and t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding).</li>
<li>Unsupervised learning is useful for exploring and understanding the structure of a dataset, and can be used for tasks such as anomaly detection and data compression. It does not require labeled data and can be used with data that has not been labeled or has incomplete labels. However, it can be more difficult to evaluate the performance of unsupervised learning algorithms, as there is no ground truth to compare the results to.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="voronoi-diagram">Voronoi diagram</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Voronoi diagram is a graphical representation of the partitioning of a plane into regions based on the distance to a set of points. It is named after Russian mathematician Georgy Voronoi, who developed the concept in 1908.</li>
<li>In a Voronoi diagram, the plane is divided into a set of cells, with each cell corresponding to one of the input points. The points are called the &ldquo;generators&rdquo; of the Voronoi diagram. Each cell consists of all points that are closer to its generator than to any other generator. The boundary between cells is called a Voronoi edge, and the points where Voronoi edges intersect are called Voronoi vertices.</li>
<li>Voronoi diagrams have a wide range of applications, including computer graphics, image processing, and spatial analysis. They are used to model the spatial distribution of points and can be used to optimize the placement of facilities, such as warehouses or cell phone towers, to minimize the distance to the nearest facility. They are also used in computer games to determine the visibility of objects on the screen and in the design of efficient algorithms for solving problems in computational geometry.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="confusion-matrix">Confusion Matrix</h2>
<h3 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy is a measure of how well a model correctly predicts the outcome of a given data sample. It is commonly used in classification problems, where the model is trying to predict a label for a given input.</li>
<li>The accuracy score is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions made by the model by the total number of predictions made. This value is then expressed as a percentage. For example, if a model made 100 predictions and 75 of them were correct, the accuracy score would be 75%.</li>
<li>To calculate the accuracy score, you need a set of predictions made by the model and the corresponding true labels for those predictions. You can then compare the predictions to the true labels to see how many were correct.</li>
<li>Here is an example of how to calculate the accuracy score in Python:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>def accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred):
    # Calculate the number of correct predictions
    correct = sum(y_true == y_pred)
    # Calculate the total number of predictions
    total = len(y_true)
    # Calculate the accuracy score as a percentage
    return correct / total * 100
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Here, y_true is a list of the true labels and y_pred is a list of the predictions made by the model. The function first calculates the number of correct predictions and then divides that by the total number of predictions to get the accuracy as a decimal. It then multiplies that value by 100 to express the accuracy as a percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="confusion-matrix-1">Confusion matrix</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A confusion matrix is a table that is used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. It helps to visualize the correct and incorrect predictions made by the model and allows you to see which classes are being predicted accurately and which are not.</p>
</li>

<p>The rows of the matrix represent the actual classes of the samples and the columns represent the predicted classes. The diagonal elements of the matrix represent the number of samples that have been correctly classified, while the off-diagonal elements represent the number of misclassified samples.</p>

<li>In this example, TP (true positive) is the number of samples that are actually positive and have been correctly predicted as positive. TN (true negative) is the number of samples that are actually negative and have been correctly predicted as negative. FP (false positive) is the number of samples that are actually negative but have been predicted as positive.

<ul>
<li>The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is a measure of the accuracy of a diagnostic test. It is used to compare the accuracy of two or more diagnostic tests or to compare the accuracy of a diagnostic test to a reference standard.</li>
<li>The DOR is calculated as the ratio of the odds of a positive test result in patients with the condition being tested for to the odds of a positive test result in patients without the condition.</li>
<li>Here is the formula for calculating the DOR:</li>

<li>The DOR can range from 0 to infinity, with higher values indicating a more accurate diagnostic test. A DOR of 1 indicates that the test is no better than a coin flip, while a DOR of infinity indicates perfect accuracy.</li>
<li>To calculate the DOR, you need a set of predictions made by the diagnostic test and the corresponding true labels for those predictions. You can then use the formula above to calculate the DOR.</li>

<h3 id="false-negative-fn">False negative (FN)</h3>
<ul>
<li>A false negative (FN) is a prediction made by a diagnostic test or classification algorithm that is incorrect. It refers to a situation where the test or algorithm predicts a negative result for a sample that is actually positive.</li>
<li>In the context of a diagnostic test, a false negative means that the test failed to detect the presence of a condition in a person who actually has the condition. In the context of a classification algorithm, a false negative means that the algorithm failed to correctly classify a positive sample.</li>
<li>False negatives are often more serious than false positives, as they can have more serious consequences. For example, if a diagnostic test for a disease returns a false negative result, the person may not receive the necessary treatment and their condition may worsen.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="false-positive-rate">False positive rate</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of diagnostic tests, the false positive rate is the probability that a patient with a negative disease status will receive a positive test result. In other words, it is the probability of a false alarm. A high false positive rate means that there is a high probability of a patient being told they have a disease when they actually do not. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety and further testing, and can also reduce the overall credibility of the diagnostic test.</li>
<li>The false positive rate is often considered in conjunction with the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test. Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient actually has the disease, and specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. Together, these measures can give a more complete picture of the performance of a diagnostic test.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="false-omission-rate">False omission rate</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of diagnostic tests, the false omission rate, also known as the false negative rate, is the probability that a patient with a positive disease status will receive a negative test result. A high false negative rate means that there is a high probability of a patient being told they do not have a disease when they actually do. This can have serious consequences, as the patient may not receive the necessary treatment.</li>
<li>The false negative rate is often considered in conjunction with the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test. Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient actually has the disease, and specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. Together, these measures can give a more complete picture of the performance of a diagnostic test.</li>
<li>For example, consider a diagnostic test for a particular disease. The test has a sensitivity of 90%, meaning that it correctly identifies 90% of patients with the disease. It also has a specificity of 95%, meaning that it correctly identifies 95% of patients who do not have the disease. However, if the disease is relatively rare, the false negative rate may still be unacceptably high. For example, if the prevalence of the disease is 1%, and the test has a false negative rate of 10%, then out of 100 patients with the disease, the test will correctly identify only 81 of them (90% sensitivity), while 19 will be misdiagnosed as not having the disease (10% false negative rate). This could lead to a significant number of missed diagnoses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hit-rate">Hit rate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hit rate, also known as the hit ratio, is a measure of the accuracy of a classifier, predictor, or other machine learning model. It is the number of times the model correctly predicts the outcome (a &ldquo;hit&rdquo;) divided by the total number of predictions made. For example, if a model makes 100 predictions and is correct 70 times, the hit rate is 70%.</li>
<li>Hit rate is often used as a measure of performance for models that make binary predictions (e.g., &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative&rdquo;). In this case, a hit is a correct prediction of the positive or negative class, and the hit rate is the proportion of positive or negative predictions that are correct.</li>
<li>Hit rate is related to the true positive rate and the false positive rate, which are measures of the performance of a binary classifier. The true positive rate is the proportion of positive cases that are correctly classified as positive, while the false positive rate is the proportion of negative cases that are incorrectly classified as positive. Together, these measures can give a more complete picture of the performance of a classifier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="miss-rate">Miss rate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Miss rate, also known as the miss ratio or false negative rate, is a measure of the accuracy of a classifier, predictor, or other machine learning model. It is the number of times the model incorrectly predicts the outcome (a &ldquo;miss&rdquo;) divided by the total number of predictions made. For example, if a model makes 100 predictions and is incorrect 30 times, the miss rate is 30%.</li>
<li>Miss rate is often used as a measure of performance for models that make binary predictions (e.g., &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative&rdquo;). In this case, a miss is an incorrect prediction of the positive or negative class, and the miss rate is the proportion of positive or negative predictions that are incorrect.</li>
<li>Miss rate is related to the true positive rate and the false positive rate, which are measures of the performance of a binary classifier. The true positive rate is the proportion of positive cases that are correctly classified as positive, while the false positive rate is the proportion of negative cases that are incorrectly classified as positive. Together, these measures can give a more complete picture of the performance of a classifier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="negative-likelihood-ratio">Negative likelihood ratio</h3>
<ul>
<li>The negative likelihood ratio (NLR) is a measure of the performance of a diagnostic test or other classifier. It is the ratio of the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease (specificity) to the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does have the disease (1 - sensitivity). The NLR is used to assess the ability of a test to rule out the presence of a disease.</li>
<li>The NLR can be calculated using the following formula: NLR = (1 - sensitivity) / specificity</li>
<li>A diagnostic test with a high NLR (greater than 1) is said to have a high negative predictive value, meaning that it is good at ruling out the presence of a disease. A test with a low NLR (less than 1) has a low negative predictive value, meaning that it is not good at ruling out the presence of a disease.</li>
<li>The NLR is often used in conjunction with the positive likelihood ratio (PLR), which is the ratio of the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease (sensitivity) to the probability of a positive test result given that the patient does not have the disease (1 - specificity). The PLR is used to assess the ability of a test to detect the presence of a disease. Together, the NLR and PLR can give a more complete picture of the performance of a diagnostic test.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="negative-predictive-value">Negative predictive value</h3>
<ul>
<li>The negative predictive value (NPV) is a measure of the performance of a diagnostic test or other classifier. It is the probability that a patient with a negative test result does not have the disease. The NPV is used to assess the ability of a test to rule out the presence of a disease.</li>
<li>The NPV can be calculated using the following formula: NPV = TN / (TN + FN)
where TN is the number of true negatives (patients with a negative test result who do not have the disease) and FN is the number of false negatives (patients with a negative test result who do have the disease).</li>
<li>A diagnostic test with a high NPV (close to 1) is said to have a high negative predictive value, meaning that it is good at ruling out the presence of a disease. A test with a low NPV (close to 0) has a low negative predictive value, meaning that it is not good at ruling out the presence of a disease.</li>
<li>The NPV is often used in conjunction with the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability that a patient with a positive test result does have the disease. The PPV is used to assess the ability of a test to detect the presence of a disease. Together, the NPV and PPV can give a more complete picture of the performance of a diagnostic test.</li>

<li>The PPV can be calculated using the following formula: PPV = TP / (TP + FP)
where TP is the number of true positives (patients with a positive test result who do have the disease) and FP is the number of false positives (patients with a positive test result who do not have the disease).</li>
<li>A diagnostic test with a high PPV (close to 1) is said to have a high positive predictive value, meaning that it is good at detecting the presence of a disease.

</ul>
<h3 id="precision">Precision</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of statistical hypothesis testing and machine learning, precision is a measure of the accuracy of a classifier, predictor, or other model. It is the number of true positive predictions made by the model divided by the total number of positive predictions made by the model. Precision is used to evaluate the performance of a model that makes binary predictions (e.g., &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative&rdquo;).</li>
<li>For example, consider a model that makes 100 predictions, of which 70 are positive and 30 are negative. If the model is correct in 60 of the positive predictions and all of the negative predictions, the precision of the model is 60/70 = 0.86. This means that of all the positive predictions made by the model, 86% are correct.</li>
<li>Precision is often used in conjunction with the recall, which is the number of true positive predictions made by the model divided by the total number of actual positive cases. Precision and recall are both used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier, and can be balanced against each other to achieve the desired trade-off in a particular application.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="recall">Recall</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of statistical hypothesis testing and machine learning, recall is a measure of the accuracy of a classifier, predictor, or other model. It is the number of true positive predictions made by the model divided by the total number of actual positive cases. Recall is used to evaluate the performance of a model that makes binary predictions (e.g., &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative&rdquo;).</li>
<li>For example, consider a model that makes 100 predictions, of which 70 are positive and 30 are negative. If the model is correct in 60 of the positive predictions and all of the negative predictions, and there are 80 actual positive cases, the recall of the model is 60/80 = 0.75. This means that of all the actual positive cases, 75% are correctly predicted by the model.</li>
<li>Recall is often used in conjunction with the precision, which is the number of true positive predictions made by the model divided by the total number of positive predictions made by the model. Precision and recall are both used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier, and can be balanced against each other to achieve the desired trade-off in a particular application.</li>

It is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient actually has the disease. Sensitivity is used to evaluate the ability of a test to detect the presence of a disease.</li>
<li>The sensitivity of a diagnostic test can be calculated using the following formula: sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) where TP is the number of true positives (patients with a positive test result who do have the disease) and FN is the number of false negatives (patients with a negative test result who do have the disease).</li>
<li>A diagnostic test with a high sensitivity (close to 1) is said to have a high true positive rate, meaning that it is good at detecting the presence of a disease. A test with a low sensitivity (close to 0) has a low true positive rate, meaning that it is not good at detecting the presence of a disease.</li>
<li>Sensitivity is often used in conjunction with the specificity of a diagnostic test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease.

In the context of statistical hypothesis testing and machine learning, a true negative is a prediction made by a model that an instance belongs to the negative class, and the instance does indeed belong to the negative class.</li>
<li>True negatives are typically represented by the letter TN in performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and the positive and negative predictive values. These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of a diagnostic test or other classifier. For example, the sensitivity of a test is the proportion of true positive predictions made by the test to the total number of actual positive cases, while the specificity of a test is the proportion of true negative predictions made by the test to the total number of actual negative cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="true-positive-tp">True positive (TP)</h3>
<ul>
<li>A true positive is a prediction made by a diagnostic test or other classifier that an event or condition is present, and the event or condition is indeed present.

<li>True positives are typically represented by the letter TP in performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and the positive and negative predictive values. These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of a diagnostic test or other classifier. For example, the sensitivity of a test is the proportion of true positive predictions made by the test to the total number of actual positive cases, while the specificity of a test is the proportion of true negative predictions made by the test to the total number of actual negative cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<h3 id="attribute">Attribute</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of data modeling and database design, an attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity, typically represented as a column in a database table. An attribute can be a simple data value (e.g., a string, integer, or date) or a complex data structure (e.g., an array or object).</li>
<li>For example, consider a database table that represents a collection of users. Each user in the table might have attributes such as name, email, and date of birth. These attributes can be used to describe the characteristics of each user in the table.</li>
<li>In the context of machine learning, an attribute is a feature or characteristic of a data instance that can be used for prediction or classification. For example, in a dataset of customer data, each customer might have attributes such as age, income, and location, which could be used to predict their purchasing behavior.</li>
<li>In both cases, the attributes of an entity or data instance are used to describe and differentiate it from other entities or instances in the same data set.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="box-and-whisker-plot">Box and whisker plot</h3>
<ul>
<li>A box and whisker plot (also known as a box plot) is a graphical representation of a set of numerical data that summarizes several important features of the data using a simple and visually effective display. It is typically used to visualize the distribution of the data and to identify any outliers or unusual observations.</li>
<li>To create a box and whisker plot, the data is first sorted into numerical order. The middle 50% of the data is then represented by a box, which extends from the lower quartile (the 25th percentile) to the upper quartile (the 75th percentile). The lower and upper quartiles are the points that divide the data into four equal parts.</li>
<li>The median (the 50th percentile) is represented by a line inside the box. The median is the middle value of the data, such that half of the data is above it and half is below it.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; of the plot extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values of the data, unless there are outliers present, in which case the whiskers extend only to the most extreme data points that are not outliers. Outliers are data points that are significantly farther from the main body of the data than the rest of the data. They are typically plotted separately as individual points on the plot.</li>
<li>Box and whisker plots are useful for comparing the distributions of different sets of data, or for identifying patterns and trends in a single set of data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="categorical-data">Categorical data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Categorical data is data that can be divided into categories or groups. These categories are usually based on some shared characteristics or qualities. Categorical data can be either nominal, meaning the categories do not have any specific order or ranking, or ordinal, meaning the categories are ranked or ordered in some way.</li>
<li>Examples of categorical data include:</li>
<li>Nominal data:
<ul>
<li>Gender (male, female)</li>
<li>Eye color (brown, blue, green)</li>
<li>Type of animal (cat, dog, bird)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ordinal data:
<ul>
<li>Educational degree (high school, bachelor&rsquo;s degree, master&rsquo;s degree)</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction ratings (very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very frustrated)</li>
<li>Military rank (private, sergeant, lieutenant, captain)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Categorical data is often used in statistical analysis, and it is important to understand the type of data you are working with in order to choose the appropriate statistical techniques and analysis tools.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collective-outlier">Collective outlier</h3>
<ul>
<li>A collective outlier is a group of data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. Collective outliers can occur when there is a group of data points that have a different distribution or pattern from the rest of the data. These data points may be the result of a measurement error, an unusual event, or a different process or population.</li>
<li>Collective outliers can be difficult to identify, as they may not stand out as clearly as individual outliers. It is important to carefully examine the data and consider the context in which it was collected to determine if a group of data points may be collective outliers.</li>
<li>There are several methods for detecting collective outliers, including visual inspection of the data, statistical tests, and machine learning algorithms. Once identified, it is important to determine the cause of the collective outliers and consider whether they should be included in the analysis or removed from the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contextual-outlier">Contextual outlier</h3>
<ul>
<li>A contextual outlier is a data point that is unusual or unexpected in the context in which it occurs, but may not be unusual if considered in a different context. Contextual outliers can occur when there are differences in the populations, processes, or environments being studied, or when the data is being collected for different purposes or using different methods.</li>
<li>For example, if you are studying the height of adult men and women, a data point representing the height of a 6-foot-tall woman might be considered a contextual outlier, as it is unusual compared to the rest of the data on women&rsquo;s height, but not necessarily unusual compared to the overall distribution of heights in the population.</li>
<li>It is important to consider the context in which the data was collected when identifying and analyzing contextual outliers. This can help to identify any underlying causes of the outlier and determine whether it is appropriate to include the outlier in the analysis or exclude it from the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="covariate">Covariate</h3>
<ul>
<li>A covariate is a variable that is correlated with another variable and is included in a statistical model to control for its effect. Covariates are often used in statistical analysis to adjust for differences between groups or to better understand the relationship between two variables.</li>
<li>For example, in a study of the relationship between age and blood pressure, age might be included as a covariate to control for its effect on blood pressure. This is because age is known to be related to blood pressure, and including it as a covariate in the statistical model can help to isolate the relationship between blood pressure and other factors being studied.</li>
<li>In general, covariates are used to improve the accuracy and validity of statistical models by accounting for the influence of other variables that might confound the relationship being studied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-point">Data point</h3>
<ul>
<li>A data point is a single piece of data or a single observation in a dataset. Data points can represent a wide variety of things, depending on the context in which the data was collected. For example, a data point might represent a person&rsquo;s age, the number of sales made by a company in a given month, the temperature at a specific location on a given day, or the result of a laboratory experiment.</li>
<li>Data points are usually organized and stored in a dataset, which can be a table, spreadsheet, or other structured format. A dataset typically contains multiple data points, and each data point is often represented by a row in the dataset.</li>
<li>Data points are used in statistical analysis to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. By examining individual data points and the relationships between them, it is possible to draw conclusions and make predictions about the population or system being studied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="detrending">Detrending</h3>
<ul>
<li>Detrending is the process of removing trends or long-term patterns from data in order to better understand short-term fluctuations or changes. Detrending is often used in time series analysis, where the goal is to identify and analyze patterns in data that occur over time.</li>
<li>There are several methods for detrending data, including:
<ul>
<li>Subtracting the mean: This method involves calculating the mean value of the data over a certain period of time, and then subtracting that value from each data point.</li>
<li>Fitting a trend line: This method involves fitting a line to the data using a statistical model, such as a linear or polynomial model, and then subtracting the predicted values from the actual data.</li>
<li>Differencing: This method involves subtracting each data point from the previous data point, which removes any trend that is present in the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Detrending can help to identify and analyze shorter-term patterns or cycles in the data, and can be useful for forecasting or predicting future values. However, it is important to carefully consider the appropriateness of detrending for a particular dataset, as removing trends can also remove important information about the underlying process or system being studied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eigenvalue">Eigenvalue</h3>
<ul>
<li>An eigenvalue is a special number that is associated with a linear transformation or matrix. In mathematics, a linear transformation is a function that maps one set of numbers (called vectors) to another set of numbers, in such a way that the transformation preserves certain properties of the original vectors. Matrices are used to represent linear transformations, and the eigenvalues of a matrix are a measure of its overall behavior or characteristics.</li>
<li>The eigenvalues of a matrix are the values that satisfy a particular equation involving the matrix and a vector. These values can be real numbers or complex numbers, and each matrix has a set of eigenvalues that are unique to that matrix.</li>
<li>Eigenvalues are used in a variety of mathematical and statistical contexts, including image processing, machine learning, and data analysis. They are often used to understand the behavior or characteristics of a matrix or linear transformation, and can be used to identify patterns or trends in data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eigenvector">Eigenvector</h3>
<ul>
<li>An eigenvector is a special type of vector that is associated with a linear transformation or matrix. In mathematics, a vector is a set of numbers that can be used to represent quantities such as position, velocity, or force. A linear transformation is a function that maps one set of vectors to another set of vectors, in such a way that the transformation preserves certain properties of the original vectors. Matrices are used to represent linear transformations, and the eigenvectors of a matrix are vectors that are unchanged (up to a scale factor) by the matrix.</li>
<li>The eigenvectors of a matrix are the vectors that satisfy a particular equation involving the matrix and the vector. These vectors can have any number of dimensions, and each matrix has a set of eigenvectors that are unique to that matrix.</li>
<li>Eigenvectors are used in a variety of mathematical and statistical contexts, including image processing, machine learning, and data analysis. They are often used to understand the behavior or characteristics of a matrix or linear transformation, and can be used to identify patterns or trends in data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feature">Feature</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of machine learning, features are pieces of data or characteristics that are used as inputs for a model. A machine learning model is a mathematical model that is trained to perform a specific task, such as classifying objects, predicting a numerical value, or generating text. In order to train a model, it is necessary to provide a set of input data, called features, along with the corresponding output data, called labels.</li>
<li>The choice of features can have a significant impact on the performance of a machine learning model. Good features should be relevant to the task being performed and should contain enough information to allow the model to make accurate predictions or decisions. In some cases, it may be necessary to transform or engineer the features in order to extract the relevant information or to improve the model&rsquo;s performance.</li>
<li>For example, in a machine learning model that is used to classify images of animals, the features might include the pixel values of the images, or characteristics such as the shape or color of the objects in the images. In a model that is used to predict the price of a house, the features might include characteristics of the house, such as the size, location, and age, as well as external factors such as the local housing market.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="imputation">Imputation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Imputation is the process of estimating or replacing missing or incomplete data in a dataset. Missing data can occur for a variety of reasons, such as errors in data collection, missing values in a database, or respondents who do not answer certain questions in a survey. Imputation is often necessary in order to use the available data for statistical analysis or machine learning tasks.</li>
<li>There are several methods for imputing missing data, including:
<ul>
<li>Mean imputation: This method involves replacing missing values with the mean or average value of the data.</li>
<li>Median imputation: This method involves replacing missing values with the median value of the data.</li>
<li>Mode imputation: This method involves replacing missing values with the most frequent or common value in the data.</li>
<li>Regression imputation: This method involves using a statistical model, such as linear regression, to predict the missing values based on the other variables in the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is important to carefully consider the appropriate method for imputing missing data, as the choice of method can affect the accuracy and validity of the results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="observation">Observation</h3>
<ul>
<li>An observation is a single piece of data or a single measure of a variable. Observations can be collected in a variety of ways, depending on the context and the purpose of the study. For example, observations might be collected through experiments, surveys, or measurements.</li>
<li>Observations are used to collect and analyze data in order to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. By examining individual observations and the relationships between them, it is possible to draw conclusions and make predictions about the population or system being studied.</li>
<li>Observations can be either qualitative, meaning they describe a characteristic or attribute of an object or phenomenon, or quantitative, meaning they represent a numerical measurement. Observations are usually organized and stored in a dataset, which can be a table, spreadsheet, or other structured format. A dataset typically contains multiple observations, and each observation is often represented by a row in the dataset.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="principal-component-analysis-pca">Principal component analysis (PCA)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by identifying and projecting the data onto a smaller set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) dimensions, called principal components.</li>
<li>PCA is often used as a preprocessing step for machine learning algorithms, as it can help to remove noise and redundancy from the data, and make the data easier to visualize and analyze. It can also help to identify patterns and trends in the data, and to identify the most important variables or features in the dataset.</li>
<li>To perform PCA, the data is first standardized, so that all of the variables have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The data is then decomposed into a set of orthogonal principal components, which are ranked in order of their importance or variability in the data. The first principal component represents the direction in the data that has the highest variance, and the subsequent principal components represent directions that have decreasing variance.</li>
<li>PCA is a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding complex datasets, and it has a wide range of applications in fields such as machine learning, data mining, and image processing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="point-outlier">Point outlier</h3>
<ul>
<li>A point outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the rest of the data. Point outliers can occur when there is an unusual or unexpected measurement, an error in data collection, or a different process or population being studied.</li>
<li>Point outliers can be identified by visual inspection of the data, or by using statistical tests or machine learning algorithms. It is important to carefully consider the cause of the outlier and determine whether it is appropriate to include the outlier in the analysis or exclude it from the data.</li>
<li>In some cases, point outliers may be the result of errors or mistakes in data collection, and it may be appropriate to remove them from the data. In other cases, point outliers may represent unusual or unexpected events or observations, and it may be important to include them in the analysis in order to better understand the underlying process or system being studied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="predictor">Predictor</h3>
<ul>
<li>A predictor is a variable that is used to predict or estimate the value of another variable, called the response variable. In statistical analysis, predictor variables are often used to build models that can be used to make predictions or estimations about the response variable.</li>
<li>For example, in a study of the relationship between age and blood pressure, age might be used as a predictor variable to predict blood pressure. In this case, age would be considered a predictor because it is believed to have an effect on blood pressure, and the goal is to use it to predict or estimate blood pressure in a given population.</li>
<li>Predictor variables can be either continuous, meaning they can take on any value within a certain range, or categorical, meaning they belong to a specific category or group. The type of predictor variables and the relationship between them and the response variable can influence the choice of statistical techniques and models that are used to analyze the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quantitative-data">Quantitative data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quantitative data is data that is numerical and can be measured or counted. Quantitative data is often used in statistical analysis to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.</li>
<li>There are two main types of quantitative data: continuous data and discrete data. Continuous data can take on any value within a certain range, such as weight, height, or temperature. Discrete data can only take on specific values, such as the number of students in a class or the number of emails a person receives in a day.</li>
<li>Examples of quantitative data include:
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Income</li>
<li>Height</li>
<li>Weight</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Distance</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Sales revenue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quantitative data is often used in statistical analysis to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. It can be analyzed using statistical techniques such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and correlation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="response">Response</h3>
<ul>
<li>In statistical analysis, the response (also known as the dependent variable) is the variable that is being predicted or estimated based on the values of one or more predictor variables (also known as independent variables).</li>
<li>For example, in a study of the relationship between age and blood pressure, blood pressure might be the response variable, and age might be a predictor variable. In this case, the goal might be to use age to predict or estimate blood pressure in a given population.</li>
<li>The response variable is often the main focus of statistical analysis, and the goal is usually to understand how the predictor variables influence the response variable. The choice of predictor variables and the relationship between them and the response variable can influence the choice of statistical techniques and models that are used to analyze the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scaling is the process of transforming data so that it is on the same scale or within the same range. Scaling is often necessary when comparing data from different sources or when the data has a wide range of values.</li>
<li>There are several methods for scaling data, including:
<ul>
<li>Min-Max scaling: This method scales the data to a specific range, such as 0 to 1, by</li>
<li>subtracting the minimum value from each data point and dividing by the range of the data.</li>
<li>Standardization: This method scales the data so that it has a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.</li>
<li>Z-score normalization: This method scales the data so that it has a mean of zero and</li>
<li>a standard deviation of one, and transforms it into a standard normal distribution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scaling can be useful for improving the performance of machine learning algorithms, as it can help to prevent certain features from dominating the model due to their large scale. Scaling can also be useful for visualizing the data and comparing different variables or datasets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="standardization">Standardization</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of machine learning, standardization refers to the process of transforming data features so that they have zero mean and unit variance. This is often done to ensure that all features are on the same scale, which can be important for some machine learning algorithms to function properly.</li>
<li>For example, suppose that you have a dataset with two features, one that ranges from 0 to 100 and another that ranges from 0 to 1. Without standardization, the feature with a larger range will dominate the model. By standardizing the data, both features will be transformed to have the same scale, which can lead to better performance from the machine learning model.</li>
<li>Standardization is typically done by subtracting the mean of each feature from the feature values and dividing by the standard deviation of the feature. This ensures that the resulting feature values have zero mean and unit variance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="structured-data">Structured data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Structured data is data that is organized in a specific way and follows a clear set of rules. It is typically stored in a tabular form, with rows representing individual instances or observations and columns representing the attributes or features of the data. Structured data can be easily processed and analyzed by machines because it follows a well-defined format.</li>
<li>Examples of structured data include databases, spreadsheets, and tables in a relational database management system (RDBMS). Structured data is often contrasted with unstructured data, which does not follow a fixed format and is more difficult for machines to process and analyze.</li>
<li>In the context of machine learning, structured data refers to data that is organized in a way that can be easily fed into a machine learning model. This often involves formatting the data into a tabular form with rows representing individual observations and columns representing the features or attributes of the data. Machine learning algorithms are typically designed to work with structured data, so it is important to ensure that the data is properly structured before using it for training or testing a model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-series-data">Time series data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time series data is a type of data that is collected over time at regular intervals. It is typically used to analyze trends and patterns in data over time. Time series data can be represented as a sequence of data points, where each data point represents the value of a particular variable at a specific time.</li>
<li>Examples of time series data include stock prices, weather data, and traffic data. Time series data can be used in a variety of applications, including financial forecasting, demand forecasting, and anomaly detection.</li>
<li>In the context of machine learning, time series data can be used to train models to make predictions about future values of a particular variable based on its past values. This can be done using techniques such as time series forecasting, which involves using machine learning algorithms to model the temporal dependencies in the data and make predictions about future values.</li>
<li>Time series data is often analyzed using specialized tools and techniques, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unstructured-data">Unstructured data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unstructured data is data that does not follow a specific format or structure. It is often unorganized and does not fit neatly into a traditional database or spreadsheet. Examples of unstructured data include natural language text, images, audio and video files, and social media posts.</li>
<li>Unstructured data is difficult for machines to process and analyze because it does not follow a fixed format. This makes it more challenging to extract insights and information from unstructured data compared to structured data, which is organized in a well-defined format and can be easily processed by machines.</li>
<li>In the context of machine learning, unstructured data can be used as input to train models, but it often requires preprocessing and feature engineering to extract relevant features that can be used by the model.</li>
<li>This can involve techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) for text data, image processing for image data, and audio processing for audio data. The extracted features can then be used to train machine learning models, which can be used to make predictions or classify the data in some way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design-of-experiments">Design of Experiments</h2>
<h3 id="ab-testing">A/B testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>A/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, is a statistical hypothesis testing procedure used to compare the results of two versions of a product or service. It is commonly used in the fields of marketing and user experience to determine which version is more effective.</li>
<li>In A/B testing, a random sample of users is selected and divided into two groups, referred to as the control group and the treatment group. The control group is exposed to the current version of the product or service, while the treatment group is exposed to the new version. The results of the two groups are then compared to determine if the new version is an improvement over the current version.</li>
<li>A/B testing is often used to test changes to websites, apps, and other products or services to determine their impact on user behavior. It is a powerful tool for making data-driven decisions because it allows you to measure the impact of a change in a controlled and statistically rigorous way.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analysis-of-variance">Analysis of Variance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical test used to compare the mean of a continuous variable between two or more groups. It is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of the groups, and if so, where the difference lies.</li>
<li>ANOVA is based on the idea of partitioning the total variance in a dataset into different components, such as the variance within each group and the variance between groups. By comparing the size of these components, ANOVA can determine whether the differences between the group means are statistically significant or if they are likely due to random chance.</li>
<li>ANOVA can be used with both categorical and continuous independent variables, and it is a widely used tool in a variety of fields, including psychology, sociology, and economics. There are several different types of ANOVA tests, including one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA, which are used in different situations depending on the design of the study.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="balanced-design">Balanced design</h3>
<ul>
<li>A balanced design is a type of experimental design in which the number of observations in each group is equal. Balanced designs are often used in experiments to ensure that the groups are comparable and that any differences between the groups can be attributed to the independent variable being tested.</li>
<li>For example, suppose that you are conducting an experiment to test the effectiveness of a new drug. You might use a balanced design by dividing the study participants into two groups: one group that receives the drug and another group that receives a placebo. By ensuring that the two groups are equal in size and composition, you can control for other factors that might influence the results and increase the reliability of your findings.</li>
<li>Balanced designs can be contrasted with unbalanced designs, in which the number of observations in each group is unequal. Unbalanced designs can be more prone to bias and may not be as reliable as balanced designs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blocking">Blocking</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of experimental design, blocking refers to the process of dividing the study subjects into groups, or &ldquo;blocks,&rdquo; based on certain factors that could potentially affect the outcome of the experiment. The goal of blocking is to control for these factors and reduce the potential for extraneous variability in the results.</li>
<li>For example, suppose that you are conducting an experiment to test the effectiveness of a new teaching method. You might use blocking by dividing the students into groups based on their prior knowledge of the subject matter, in order to control for differences in their initial understanding. By ensuring that the groups are balanced with respect to this factor, you can increase the reliability of your findings and reduce the risk of confounding variables influencing the results.</li>
<li>Blocking is often used in conjunction with randomization, in which the subjects within each block are randomly assigned to the different treatment groups. This helps to further control for extraneous variables and increase the internal validity of the experiment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="control">Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of experimental design, a control group is a group of subjects that does not receive the treatment being tested. The control group is used for comparison with the experimental group, which does receive the treatment. By comparing the results of the two groups, researchers can determine the effect of the treatment on the outcome of interest.</li>
<li>The control group is an important element of experimental design because it helps to control for extraneous variables that might influence the results. For example, suppose that you are conducting an experiment to test the effectiveness of a new drug. By including a control group that does not receive the drug, you can control for other factors that might affect the outcome, such as the placebo effect or the natural course of the disease.</li>
<li>In order to be effective, the control group should be similar to the experimental group in all aspects except for the treatment being tested. This helps to ensure that any differences between the two groups can be attributed to the treatment, rather than other factors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-of-experiments-1">Design of experiments</h3>
<ul>
<li>The design of experiments (DOE) refers to the systematic and scientific approach to planning, conducting, analyzing, and interpreting experiments. It is a powerful tool for understanding the relationships between variables and for making informed decisions based on data.</li>
<li>The goal of DOE is to identify the key factors that affect the outcome of an experiment and to determine the optimal combination of these factors. This is typically done by manipulating the levels of the different variables and observing the resulting changes in the outcome.</li>
<li>There are many different types of experimental designs, including randomized controlled trials, cross-over designs, and factorial designs. The choice of design depends on the specific research question being addressed and the resources available for the experiment.</li>
<li>DOE is widely used in a variety of fields, including medicine, engineering, and the social sciences. It is an important tool for scientific research and for making data-driven decisions in a variety of settings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exploitation refers to the act of using something or someone to achieve a benefit or gain, often in a way that is unfair or unethical. In the context of machine learning, exploitation can refer to the use of data or algorithms in ways that unfairly advantage certain individuals or groups, or that violate the privacy or autonomy of those whose data is being used.</li>
<li>For example, exploitation in machine learning could involve using sensitive personal data for purposes that were not disclosed to the individual when the data was collected, or using algorithms that are biased against certain groups. Such practices can lead to negative consequences for those affected by the exploitation, including loss of privacy, discrimination, or loss of opportunities.</li>
<li>It is important to be aware of the potential for exploitation in machine learning and to take steps to ensure that data and algorithms are used ethically and responsibly. This can involve adopting ethical principles and guidelines, such as those put forth by organizations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the International Association for AI and Ethics (IAAIE).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exploration">Exploration</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of design of experiments (DOE), exploration refers to the process of systematically varying the levels of the input factors in order to better understand the response of the system being studied. Exploration is an important aspect of DOE because it helps to identify the important factors that influence the response, as well as the relationships between these factors and the response.</li>
<li>This information can be used to optimize the system by identifying the optimal levels of the input factors for a desired response. Exploration can be carried out using a variety of DOE techniques, such as factorial designs, response surface methodology, and DOE software tools.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="factorial-design">Factorial design</h3>
<ul>
<li>A factorial design is a type of experimental design in which multiple levels of multiple input factors are tested simultaneously. This allows researchers to study the combined effect of multiple factors on a response, as well as the interaction between the factors.</li>
<li>Factorial designs are commonly used in DOE because they are efficient and can provide a lot of information about the system being studied. For example, if there are two factors being studied, each at two levels, a 2x2 factorial design would involve testing all four possible combinations of the factor levels. This allows researchers to see how the response changes as each factor is varied independently, as well as how the response changes when the factors are combined.</li>
<li>Factorial designs can have more than two factors and more than two levels per factor. The number of treatment combinations in a factorial design increases quickly as the number of factors and levels increases, so it is important to carefully plan the design to ensure that it is both practical and efficient.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fractional-factorial-design">Fractional factorial design</h3>
<ul>
<li>A fractional factorial design is a type of experimental design that is similar to a full factorial design, but involves testing only a fraction of the possible combinations of factor levels. This allows researchers to study the effects of multiple factors with a smaller number of experimental runs.</li>
<li>Fractional factorial designs are useful when there are a large number of factors that need to be studied, or when it is not practical or cost-effective to test all possible combinations of factor levels. However, because not all combinations of factor levels are tested, a fractional factorial design may not be as accurate as a full factorial design.</li>
<li>There are several types of fractional factorial designs, including two-level fractional factorial designs, which involve testing only a fraction of the possible combinations of two levels of each factor, and Plackett-Burman designs, which are a type of fractional factorial design that is commonly used to identify the important factors in a system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="full-factorial-design">Full factorial design</h3>
<ul>
<li>A full factorial design is a type of experimental design in which all possible combinations of the levels of multiple input factors are tested. This allows researchers to study the combined effect of multiple factors on a response, as well as the interaction between the factors.</li>
<li>Full factorial designs are commonly used in design of experiments (DOE) because they provide a lot of information about the system being studied. For example, if there are two factors being studied, each at two levels, a full factorial design would involve testing all four possible combinations of the factor levels. This allows researchers to see how the response changes as each factor is varied independently, as well as how the response changes when the factors are combined.</li>
<li>Full factorial designs can have more than two factors and more than two levels per factor. The number of treatment combinations in a full factorial design increases quickly as the number of factors and levels increases, so it is important to carefully plan the design to ensure that it is both practical and efficient.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multi-armed-bandit">Multi-armed bandit</h3>
<ul>
<li>A multi-armed bandit is a type of optimization problem that involves balancing the exploration of different options (the &ldquo;arms&rdquo; of the bandit) with the exploitation of the best option known so far. The goal is to maximize the reward over time by choosing the arm that is most likely to provide the highest reward at each step.</li>
<li>The multi-armed bandit problem is often used to model situations in which there is a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. For example, in online advertising, a website owner may need to choose which ads to display to a user. The website owner may not know which ad will be the most effective at converting the user into a customer, so they must balance the need to explore different ads with the need to exploit the most effective ad.</li>
<li>There are various algorithms that can be used to solve the multi-armed bandit problem, such as the epsilon-greedy algorithm and the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm. These algorithms use different approaches to balance exploration and exploitation, and can be modified to suit the specific needs of a given application.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="response-surface">Response surface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Response surface methodology (RSM) is a statistical technique used to model and optimize the relationship between one or more input variables (also known as factors or independent variables) and an output variable (also known as the response). RSM involves designing experiments to study the response of a system to different levels of the input variables, and then fitting a mathematical model to the data to represent the relationship between the variables.</li>
<li>The response surface is the graphical representation of the response of the system as a function of the input variables. It is usually a two-dimensional plot showing the response as a function of two input variables, although it can also be a three-dimensional plot for systems with three or more input variables. The response surface can be used to identify the optimal combination of input variables that produce the desired response, as well as to understand the nature of the relationship between the variables.</li>
<li>RSM is commonly used in engineering and scientific research to optimize processes and products, and it can be applied to a wide range of systems and industries.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="game-theory">Game Theory</h2>
<h3 id="cooperative-game-theory">Cooperative game theory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cooperative game theory is a branch of game theory that studies situations in which multiple players can form coalitions and make binding agreements in order to achieve a common goal. In cooperative game theory, the players are assumed to be rational and to act in their own self-interest, but they are also able to communicate and make agreements with each other.</li>
<li>One important concept in cooperative game theory is the concept of the &ldquo;value&rdquo; of a game, which is the maximum payoff that can be achieved by the players if they cooperate. The value of a game can be determined using various solution concepts, such as the Shapley value, the nucleolus, and the core. These solution concepts provide a way to divide the value of the game among the players in a fair and stable way.</li>
<li>Cooperative game theory is used in a variety of fields, including economics, political science, and computer science. It is particularly useful for studying situations in which the players have conflicting interests, but may still be able to cooperate in order to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="game-theory-1">Game theory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions between rational decision-makers. It has applications in a wide range of disciplines, including economics, political science, and psychology, as well as in biology and computer science.</li>
<li>In game theory, a &ldquo;game&rdquo; is defined as a situation in which multiple players, called &ldquo;players,&rdquo; have to make decisions that will affect the outcome of the game. Each player has a set of possible actions they can take, called a &ldquo;strategy,&rdquo; and a corresponding payoff that depends on the strategies chosen by all the players. The players are assumed to be rational and to act in their own self-interest, trying to maximize their payoff.</li>
<li>There are two main types of games in game theory: cooperative games and non-cooperative games. In cooperative games, the players can form coalitions and make binding agreements, while in non-cooperative games, the players act independently and cannot make agreements.</li>
<li>Game theory has been used to study a wide range of real-world situations, including auctions, negotiation, and voting systems. It has also been used to analyze strategic interactions in biology, such as predator-prey relationships and the evolution of social behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mixed-strategyrandomized-strategy">Mixed strategy/randomized strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li>In game theory, a mixed strategy is a strategy in which a player randomly selects one of several pure strategies with a specified probability. A pure strategy is a strategy in which the player always chooses a particular action, while a mixed strategy allows the player to choose among several different actions with some probability.</li>
<li>Mixed strategies are often used to model situations in which a player has incomplete information about the other player&rsquo;s strategies or preferences, or in which the payoffs for each action are not fixed and may vary from one round of the game to the next.</li>
<li>In non-cooperative games, mixed strategies can be used to find a Nash equilibrium, which is a situation in which no player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy given the strategies of the other players. In a Nash equilibrium, each player&rsquo;s mixed strategy is a best response to the mixed strategies of the other players.</li>
<li>Mixed strategies can also be used in cooperative games, although they are not always necessary to find a solution. In cooperative games, mixed strategies can be used to divide the value of the game among the players in a fair and stable way.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prisoners-dilemma">Prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma</h3>
<ul>
<li>The prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma is a classic example of a game used to illustrate the concept of game theory. It is a non-cooperative game that involves two players who must decide whether to cooperate with each other or to defect (i.e., not cooperate).</li>
<li>In the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma, the players are assumed to be two prisoners who are being held in separate cells and are offered the following deal: if both prisoners defect, each one will serve a two-year prison sentence; if one defects and the other cooperates, the defector will go free while the cooperator will serve a three-year prison sentence; and if both cooperate, each one will serve a one-year prison sentence.</li>
<li>The prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma is interesting because the rational choice for each player, given the other player&rsquo;s choice, is to defect. However, if both players defect, they both end up with a worse outcome than if they had cooperated. This illustrates the concept of the &ldquo;prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma,&rdquo; in which individual rationality leads to a suboptimal outcome for both players.</li>
<li>The prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma has been used to model a wide range of real-world situations, including negotiations, international relations, and the evolution of social behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pure-strategy">Pure strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li>In game theory, a pure strategy is a strategy in which a player always chooses a particular action. A pure strategy is contrasted with a mixed strategy, in which a player randomly selects one of several actions with a specified probability.</li>
<li>Pure strategies are often used to model situations in which a player has complete information about the other player&rsquo;s strategies or preferences, or in which the payoffs for each action are fixed and do not vary from one round of the game to the next.</li>
<li>In non-cooperative games, pure strategies can be used to find a Nash equilibrium, which is a situation in which no player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy given the strategies of the other players. In a Nash equilibrium, each player&rsquo;s pure strategy is a best response to the pure strategies of the other players.</li>
<li>Pure strategies can also be used in cooperative games, although they are not always necessary to find a solution. In cooperative games, pure strategies can be used to divide the value of the game among the players in a fair and stable way.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sequential-game">Sequential game</h3>
<ul>
<li>A sequential game is a type of game in which the players take turns making decisions, and the actions of each player depend on the actions of the previous players. In a sequential game, the players have the opportunity to observe the actions of the other players before making their own decisions, which allows them to adjust their strategies based on the actions of the other players.</li>
<li>Sequential games can be either cooperative or non-cooperative. In cooperative sequential games, the players can communicate and make binding agreements with each other, while in non-cooperative sequential games, the players act independently and cannot make agreements.</li>
<li>There are several solution concepts that can be used to analyze sequential games, including the subgame perfect equilibrium, the backward induction solution, and the trembling hand perfect equilibrium. These solution concepts provide a way to predict the outcomes of sequential games and to understand the strategic interactions between the players.</li>
<li>Sequential games are often used to model real-world situations in which the players have the opportunity to observe and learn from each other&rsquo;s actions, such as in auctions and negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simultaneous-game">Simultaneous game</h3>
<ul>
<li>A simultaneous game is a type of game in which all of the players make their decisions at the same time, without knowing the decisions of the other players. In a simultaneous game, the players have to make their decisions based on their beliefs about the other players&rsquo; strategies or preferences, rather than on the actual actions of the other players.</li>
<li>Simultaneous games can be either cooperative or non-cooperative. In cooperative simultaneous games, the players can communicate and make binding agreements with each other, while in non-cooperative simultaneous games, the players act independently and cannot make agreements.</li>
<li>There are several solution concepts that can be used to analyze simultaneous games, including the Nash equilibrium, the correlated equilibrium, and the rationalizability concept. These solution concepts provide a way to predict the outcomes of simultaneous games and to understand the strategic interactions between the players.</li>
<li>Simultaneous games are often used to model real-world situations in which the players make their decisions simultaneously and do not have the opportunity to observe each other&rsquo;s actions, such as in auctions and political elections.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stable-equilibrium">Stable equilibrium</h3>
<ul>
<li>An equilibrium is a state in which no player has an incentive to change their behavior given the behavior of the other players. In game theory, an equilibrium is considered &ldquo;stable&rdquo; if it is the unique outcome of the game and if all the players are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
<li>There are several types of stable equilibria in game theory, including the Nash equilibrium, the correlated equilibrium, and the rationalizability concept. These solution concepts provide a way to predict the outcomes of games and to understand the strategic interactions between the players.</li>
<li>Stable equilibria are important because they provide a way to predict the behavior of players in strategic situations. They are often used to model real-world situations in which the players have conflicting interests and must make decisions that will affect the outcome of the game.</li>
<li>In order for an equilibrium to be stable, it must be the unique outcome of the game and all the players must be satisfied with the outcome. This means that if any player has an incentive to deviate from the equilibrium, the equilibrium is not stable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-sum-game">Zero-sum game</h3>
<ul>
<li>A zero-sum game is a type of game in which the total gain or loss of the players is always zero. This means that the gain of one player is exactly balanced by the loss of the other player(s).</li>
<li>In a zero-sum game, the players are in direct competition with each other, and the outcome of the game depends on the relative skill of the players. If one player wins, the other player(s) must lose an equal amount.</li>
<li>Examples of zero-sum games include poker, chess, and the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma. In these games, one player&rsquo;s gain is exactly offset by the other player&rsquo;s loss, so the total gain or loss of the players is always zero.</li>
<li>Zero-sum games are important in game theory because they provide a simple and well-defined framework for analyzing strategic interactions between players. They are also important in economics, where they are used to model situations in which the total resources available to the players are fixed and cannot be increased or decreased.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="model-quality">Model Quality</h2>
<h3 id="akaike-information-criterion-aic">Akaike information criterion (AIC)</h3>
<ul>
<li>AIC stands for &ldquo;Akaike&rsquo;s Information Criterion.&rdquo; It is a statistical measure that is used to evaluate the quality of a statistical model. The AIC is based on the idea that the best model is the one that strikes the right balance between fit to the data and parsimony (i.e., simplicity).</li>
<li>The AIC is calculated as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>AIC = 2k - 2ln(L)
</code></pre><p>where k is the number of parameters in the model and L is the maximum likelihood of the model. The AIC is a measure of the relative quality of a model, with lower values indicating a better model.</p>
<ul>
<li>The AIC is often used in model selection, where it is used to compare the relative quality of different models. It can also be used to compare the quality of nested models, where one model is a special case of another model.</li>
<li>The AIC is widely used in statistics and is particularly useful for comparing models with different numbers of parameters. It has been applied in a wide range of fields, including economics, engineering, and the natural sciences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bayesian-information-criterion-bic">Bayesian Information criterion (BIC)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is a statistical measure that is used to evaluate the quality of a statistical model. It is based on the idea that the best model is the one that strikes the right balance between fit to the data and parsimony (i.e., simplicity).</li>
<li>The BIC is calculated as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>BIC = kln(n) - 2ln(L)
</code></pre><p>where k is the number of parameters in the model, n is the number of data points, and L is the maximum likelihood of the model. The BIC is a measure of the relative quality of a model, with lower values indicating a better model.</p>
<ul>
<li>The BIC is often used in model selection, where it is used to compare the relative quality of different models. It can also be used to compare the quality of nested models, where one model is a special case of another model.</li>
<li>The BIC is widely used in statistics and is particularly useful for comparing models with different numbers of parameters. It has been applied in a wide range of fields, including economics, engineering, and the natural sciences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="causation">Causation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Causation refers to the relationship between an event (the cause) and a second event (the effect), where the second event is the result of the first. In order for an event to be considered the cause of another event, it must be shown that there is a clear link between the two events and that the first event directly led to the second event.</li>
<li>There are several factors that are often used to establish causation, including the following:
<ul>
<li>Temporal precedence: The cause must occur before the effect.</li>
<li>Covariation: The cause and effect must vary together.</li>
<li>Control: When other variables are controlled for, the cause and effect should still be related.</li>
<li>Plausibility: The proposed cause must be scientifically plausible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Establishing causation can be challenging, particularly in complex systems where there may be multiple potential causes and it is difficult to control for all other variables. In these cases, it is often necessary to use statistical methods to assess the strength of the relationship between the cause and effect.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="corrected-aic">Corrected AIC</h3>
<ul>
<li>Corrected AIC, also known as AICc, is a variant of Akaike&rsquo;s Information Criterion (AIC) that is used to evaluate the quality of a statistical model. Like the AIC, the AICc is based on the idea that the best model is the one that strikes the right balance between fit to the data and parsimony (i.e., simplicity).</li>
<li>The AICc is calculated as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>AICc = AIC + (2k(k + 1)) / (n - k - 1)
</code></pre><p>where k is the number of parameters in the model, n is the number of data points, and AIC is Akaike&rsquo;s Information Criterion. The AICc is a measure of the relative quality of a model, with lower values indicating a better model.</p>
<ul>
<li>The AICc is often used in model selection, where it is used to compare the relative quality of different models. It is particularly useful for comparing models with small sample sizes, as it adjusts for the bias that can occur when using the AIC with small sample sizes.</li>
<li>The AICc is widely used in statistics and has been applied in a wide range of fields, including economics, engineering, and the natural sciences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="correlation">Correlation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Correlation is a statistical measure of the relationship between two variables. It is a way to describe the degree to which two variables are related to each other.</li>
<li>The correlation between two variables is usually represented by the correlation coefficient, which can range from -1 to 1. A correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other decreases. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other also increases. A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation.</li>
<li>Correlation does not imply causation, meaning that the presence of a correlation between two variables does not necessarily mean that one variable is causing the other. It is possible for two variables to be correlated without there being a causal relationship between them.</li>
<li>Correlation is an important statistical concept that is used in a wide range of fields, including economics, psychology, and the natural sciences. It is often used to understand the relationship between different variables and to predict future outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cross-validation">Cross-validation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cross-validation is a method used to evaluate the performance of a statistical model. It involves dividing the data into a training set, which is used to train the model, and a test set, which is used to evaluate the model.</li>
<li>There are several types of cross-validation, including the following:
<ul>
<li>K-fold cross-validation: The data is divided into k folds, and the model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold being used as the test set each time.</li>
<li>Leave-one-out cross-validation: The model is trained on all but one data point, and then tested on the left-out data point. This process is repeated for each data point, resulting in a model being trained and tested n times, where n is the number of data points.</li>
<li>Stratified cross-validation: The data is divided into folds such that the proportions of different classes in the folds are similar to the proportions in the entire dataset. This is useful when the classes are imbalanced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cross-validation is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of a statistical model and for selecting the best model for a given dataset. It helps to ensure that the model is not overfitted to the training data and that it generalizes well to unseen data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hypothesis-test">Hypothesis test</h3>
<ul>
<li>A hypothesis test is a statistical procedure used to test whether a hypothesis about a population parameter is true or false. It involves collecting data from a sample and using it to make a decision about the hypothesis.</li>
<li>The process of conducting a hypothesis test usually involves the following steps:
<ul>
<li>State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis is the assumption that there is no relationship between the variables being tested, while the alternative hypothesis is the assumption that there is a relationship.</li>
<li>Select a sample and collect data. The sample should be representative of the population being studied.</li>
<li>Choose a test statistic and a critical value. The test statistic is a measure of the difference between the sample and the null hypothesis, while the critical value is a predetermined threshold that is used to decide whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>Calculate the p-value. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true.</li>
<li>Make a decision. If the p-value is less than the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis is not rejected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hypothesis tests are an important tool for making decisions about statistical relationships and are widely used in a variety of fields, including psychology, economics, and the natural sciences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="k-fold-cross-validation">k-fold cross-validation</h3>
<ul>
<li>K-fold cross-validation is a method used to evaluate the performance of a statistical model. It involves dividing the data into k folds (also known as &ldquo;subsets&rdquo;) and training the model k times, each time using a different fold as the test set and the remaining folds as the training set. The performance of the model is then averaged across the k iterations.</li>
<li>For example, in 5-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into 5 folds, and the model is trained and tested 5 times. Each time, a different fold is used as the test set, and the model is trained on the other 4 folds. The performance of the model is then averaged across the 5 iterations.</li>
<li>K-fold cross-validation is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of a model and for selecting the best model for a given dataset. It helps to ensure that the model is not overfitted to the training data and that it generalizes well to unseen data.</li>
<li>K-fold cross-validation is a widely used method in machine learning and is particularly useful for small datasets, where it can provide a more reliable estimate of model performance than other methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="likelihood">Likelihood</h3>
<ul>
<li>In statistics, the likelihood of a model is a measure of how well the model fits the data. It is defined as the probability of observing the data given the model and a set of parameters.</li>
<li>The likelihood is often used to compare the fit of different models to the same data. A higher likelihood indicates a better fit, while a lower likelihood indicates a poorer fit.</li>
<li>The likelihood is often used in maximum likelihood estimation, a method used to estimate the parameters of a statistical model. In maximum likelihood estimation, the parameters of the model are chosen to maximize the likelihood of the model given the data.</li>
<li>The likelihood is an important concept in statistics that is used in a wide range of applications, including hypothesis testing, model selection, and statistical inference. It provides a way to evaluate the fit of a model to the data and to compare the fit of different models to the same data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="maximum-likelihood">Maximum likelihood</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maximum likelihood is a method used to estimate the parameters of a statistical model. It is based on the idea of finding the set of parameters that maximize the likelihood of the model given the data.</li>
<li>The likelihood of a model is a measure of how well the model fits the data. It is defined as the probability of observing the data given the model and a set of parameters. In maximum likelihood estimation, the parameters of the model are chosen to maximize the likelihood of the model given the data.</li>
<li>Maximum likelihood estimation has several desirable properties, including being asymptotically efficient (i.e., the estimators converge to the true values as the sample size increases) and being relatively easy to implement. It is widely used in a variety of fields, including economics, psychology, and the natural sciences.</li>
<li>Maximum likelihood estimation is often used in conjunction with other statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing and model selection, to make inferences about the underlying population from which the data were collected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="missing-data">Missing data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Missing data refers to data that is not available or that has not been collected. It is a common problem in statistical analysis and can occur for a variety of reasons, including errors in data collection, missing values in the data, and data that is not recorded.</li>
<li>Missing data can be a problem because it can bias the results of statistical analyses. For example, if the missing data is not randomly distributed, it can lead to sampling bias and affect the validity of the conclusions.</li>
<li>There are several approaches for dealing with missing data, including the following:
<ul>
<li>Complete case analysis: This involves removing any cases with missing data from the analysis. This is the simplest approach, but it can lead to biased results if the missing data is not missing at random.</li>
<li>Imputation: This involves replacing the missing values with estimates based on the available data. There are several methods for imputing missing data, including mean imputation, regression imputation, and multiple imputation.</li>
<li>Maximum likelihood: This involves using a statistical model to estimate the missing data based on the observed data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The best approach for dealing with missing data depends on the nature of the missing data and the goals of the analysis. It is important to carefully consider the implications of missing data and choose an appropriate approach to ensure the validity of the results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="random-effects">Random effects</h3>
<ul>
<li>In statistics, a random effect is a variable that is included in a statistical model to account for the fact that the data is a sample from a larger population. Random effects are used to model the variability between different groups or individuals in the population.</li>
<li>For example, consider a study that aims to investigate the relationship between diet and blood pressure. In this study, the researchers might collect data from several different groups of people, such as men and women, or people from different countries. If the researchers want to account for the fact that the data is a sample from a larger population, they might include a random effect for group in their statistical model. This would allow them to estimate the average effect of diet on blood pressure within each group, as well as the overall effect across all groups.</li>
<li>Random effects are often used in mixed-effects models, which are used to analyze data that has both fixed and random effects. They are an important tool for understanding the sources of variability in data and for making inferences about the population from which the data were collected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="real-effects">Real effects</h3>
<ul>
<li>In statistics, a real effect is a variable that is included in a statistical model to represent an underlying relationship or effect that is believed to exist in the population. Real effects are often used to test hypotheses about the relationships between variables and to estimate the strength and direction of those relationships.</li>
<li>For example, consider a study that aims to investigate the relationship between diet and blood pressure. In this study, the researchers might collect data from a sample of people and include a real effect for diet in their statistical model. This would allow them to estimate the average effect of diet on blood pressure in the population and to test whether this effect is statistically significant.</li>
<li>Real effects are often contrasted with random effects, which are used to account for the fact that the data is a sample from a larger population. While real effects represent underlying relationships in the population, random effects represent the variability between different groups or individuals in the population.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sum-of-squared-errors">Sum-of-squared errors</h3>
<ul>
<li>The sum of squared errors (SSE) is a measure of the deviation of a set of values from a predicted value. It is often used in statistical analysis to evaluate the fit of a model to a set of data.</li>
<li>The SSE is calculated as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>SSE = ∑(observed value - predicted value)^2
</code></pre><p>where the sum is taken over all the data points.</p>
<ul>
<li>The SSE is a measure of the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values. It is a common measure of the error or deviation of a set of values from a predicted value, and it is often used to compare the fit of different models to the same data.</li>
<li>In general, a smaller SSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data, while a larger SSE indicates a poorer fit. The SSE is often used in conjunction with other measures of fit, such as the coefficient of determination (R^2), to evaluate the quality of a statistical model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-datatest-set">Test data/test set</h3>
<ul>
<li>A test set is a set of data that is used to evaluate the performance of a statistical model. It is separate from the training set, which is used to fit the model, and is used to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.</li>
<li>The test set is often used to estimate the accuracy of the model, as well as other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. It is a crucial step in the model development process, as it allows the model to be evaluated on data that it has not seen before and provides a way to assess the generalizability of the model.</li>
<li>The test set is usually chosen to be representative of the data that the model will encounter in real-world use. It is important to ensure that the test set is independent of the training set and that it is not used in any way to fit the model.</li>
<li>The test set is an important tool for evaluating the performance of a statistical model and for comparing the performance of different models. It is widely used in a variety of fields, including machine learning, data mining, and statistical analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="training-datatraining-set">Training data/training set</h3>
<ul>
<li>The training data or training set is a set of data that is used to fit a statistical model. It is used to learn the parameters of the model and to improve the model&rsquo;s ability to make predictions on new, unseen data.</li>
<li>The training set is usually a subset of the total dataset and is chosen to be representative of the data that the model will encounter in real-world use. It is important to ensure that the training set is representative of the data that the model will encounter in order to improve the model&rsquo;s ability to generalize to new data.</li>
<li>The training set is used to fit the model by adjusting the model&rsquo;s parameters to minimize the error between the predicted values and the observed values. Once the model has been trained on the training set, it can be evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance on new data.</li>
<li>The training set is an important tool for building and evaluating statistical models and is widely used in a variety of fields, including machine learning, data mining, and statistical analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="validation-datavalidation-set">Validation data/validation set</h3>
<ul>
<li>The validation data or validation set is a set of data that is used to evaluate the performance of a statistical model. It is used to tune the model&rsquo;s hyperparameters and to select the best model among a set of candidates.</li>
<li>The validation set is usually a subset of the total dataset and is used to assess the model&rsquo;s ability to generalize to new, unseen data. It is important to ensure that the validation set is independent of the training set and is not used to fit the model in any way.</li>
<li>The validation set is used to compare the performance of different models and to select the best model based on a predetermined criterion, such as the accuracy of the model or the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Once the best model has been selected, it can be evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance on new data.</li>
<li>The validation set is an important tool for building and evaluating statistical models and is widely used in a variety of fields, including machine learning, data mining, and statistical analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="non-parametric-tests">Non-Parametric Tests</h2>
<h3 id="mann-whitney-test">Mann-Whitney test</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Mann-Whitney test is a nonparametric statistical test used to compare the means of two independent samples. It is used when the data is not normally distributed or when the variances of the two samples are not equal.</li>
<li>The Mann-Whitney test is based on the ranks of the data rather than the raw data values. It involves ranking the data from the two samples and comparing the ranks of the observations from the two samples.</li>
<li>The Mann-Whitney test is used to test the hypothesis that the two samples come from the same population. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the two samples.</li>
<li>The Mann-Whitney test is a widely used statistical test and is particularly useful when the assumptions of other tests, such as the t-test, are not met. It is an important tool for understanding the relationship between variables and for making inferences about the underlying populations from which the samples were drawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mcnemars-test">McNemar&rsquo;s test</h3>
<ul>
<li>McNemar&rsquo;s test is a statistical test used to compare the proportions of two dependent samples. It is used when the data is in the form of pairs, such as before and after measurements on the same group of individuals.</li>
<li>The McNemar&rsquo;s test is used to test the hypothesis that the proportions of the two samples are equal. It is based on the difference between the two proportions and is used to determine whether the difference is statistically significant.</li>
<li>The McNemar&rsquo;s test is a nonparametric test, which means that it does not assume that the data follows a specific distribution. It is often used when the assumptions of other tests, such as the chi-squared test, are not met.</li>
<li>The McNemar&rsquo;s test is an important tool for understanding the relationship between variables and for making inferences about the underlying populations from which the samples were drawn. It is widely used in a variety of fields, including psychology, medicine, and the social sciences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nonparametric-test">Nonparametric test</h3>
<ul>
<li>A nonparametric test is a statistical test that does not assume that the data follows a specific distribution. Nonparametric tests are often used when the assumptions of parametric tests, such as the t-test or the ANOVA test, are not met or when the sample size is too small to make such assumptions.</li>
<li>Nonparametric tests are based on the ranks or the frequencies of the data rather than the raw data values. They are often used to compare the means or proportions of two or more groups or to test for associations between variables.</li>
<li>Some examples of nonparametric tests include the Mann-Whitney test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, the chi-squared test, and the McNemar&rsquo;s test.</li>
<li>Nonparametric tests are an important tool for understanding the relationship between variables and for making inferences about the underlying populations from which the samples were drawn. They are widely used in a variety of fields, including psychology, medicine, and the social sciences.</li>

<li>Paired samples are often used when the two samples are dependent, meaning that the measurements in one sample are related to the measurements in the other sample. For example, paired samples might be used to compare the scores of the same group of individuals on two different tests, or to compare the blood pressure of the same group of individuals before and after a treatment.</li>
<li>Paired samples can be analyzed using parametric or nonparametric statistical tests, depending on the assumptions of the data. Some examples of statistical tests for paired samples include the paired t-test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the McNemar&rsquo;s test.</li>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<h3 id="approximate-dynamic-program">Approximate dynamic program</h3>

<li>Approximate dynamic programming is a method for solving optimization problems that involves iteratively improving approximate solutions to a problem. It is often used when the exact solution to the problem is computationally intractable, but it is possible to compute approximate solutions that are good enough for a particular application.</li>
<li>In approximate dynamic programming, a sequence of approximate solutions is generated, with each successive solution being an improvement upon the previous one.

<h3 id="arc">Arc</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of optimization, an arc is a continuous path between two points in a graph or network. Arcs are often used to represent connections or relationships between variables or points in a problem.</li>
<li>In mathematical optimization, arcs can be used to represent constraints or limitations on the solution to a problem. For example, in a transportation optimization problem, arcs might represent the routes that can be taken between different locations, and the cost of traveling along each route. The optimization problem would then involve finding the lowest cost path that satisfies all of the constraints represented by the arcs.</li>
<li>Arcs can also be used to represent relationships between variables in a problem. For example, in a linear programming problem, arcs might represent the flow of a resource between different locations or activities.

</ul>
<h3 id="assignment-problem">Assignment problem</h3>
<ul>
<li>The assignment problem is a type of optimization problem that involves finding the optimal way to assign a set of resources to a set of tasks. The goal of the assignment problem is to minimize the total cost of the assignment, where the cost of an assignment is the sum of the cost of assigning each resource to its corresponding task.
-The assignment problem can be represented as a bipartite graph, with one set of vertices representing the resources and the other set representing the tasks. Arcs are then drawn between the vertices, with the cost of assigning a resource to a task being represented by the weight of the corresponding arc. The assignment problem then involves finding a complete matching (a set of arcs such that every vertex is incident to exactly one arc) in the graph that minimizes the total arc weight.</li>

<h3 id="bellmans-equation">Bellman&rsquo;s equation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bellman&rsquo;s equation is a mathematical equation that is used in dynamic programming to compute the value of a given state in a Markov decision process. It is named after Richard Bellman, who introduced the concept of dynamic programming in the 1950s.</li>
<li>In dynamic programming, a Markov decision process is represented as a sequence of states, transitions, and rewards. At each time step, the decision maker can choose from a set of actions that will transition the system to a new state. The value of a state is defined as the expected sum of future rewards that can be obtained by starting in that state and following an optimal policy.</li>
<li>Bellman&rsquo;s equation is used to compute the value of a given state by considering all of the possible actions that can be taken from that state and the resulting rewards and next states. It is typically written as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>V(s) = max[R(s,a) + γV(s&#39;)]
</code></pre><p>where V(s) is the value of state s, R(s,a) is the reward for taking action a in state s, s&rsquo; is the next state resulting from taking action a in state s, and γ is a discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards relative to immediate rewards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bellman&rsquo;s equation is used to solve many different types of optimization problems, including problems in economics, engineering, and computer science.</li>

<h3 id="binary-integer-program">Binary integer program</h3>
<ul>
<li>A binary integer program (BIP) is a type of mathematical optimization problem in which the variables are restricted to be binary (i.e., either 0 or 1) and the objective function and constraints are linear. BIPs are often used to model decision-making problems in which the variables represent the selection or assignment of resources, and the objective function and constraints represent the costs and limitations of the problem.</li>
<li>BIP problems can be expressed in the following standard form:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>maximize c^T x
subject to Ax &lt;= b
x is binary
</code></pre><p>where x is a vector of binary variables, c is a vector of coefficients representing the objective function, A is a matrix of coefficients representing the constraints, and b is a vector of constants representing the right-hand side of the constraints.</p>
<ul>
<li>BIP problems can be solved using a variety of algorithms, including branch and bound, cutting plane, and branch and cut. They have a wide range of applications, including resource allocation, scheduling, and transportation optimization.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="binary-variable">Binary variable</h3>
<ul>
<li>In optimization, a binary variable is a type of decision variable that can take on only two values: 0 or 1. Binary variables are often used to represent choices or assignments in optimization problems, where a value of 0 indicates that the corresponding choice or assignment is not made, and a value of 1 indicates that it is made.</li>
<li>Binary variables are commonly used in mathematical optimization to model problems in which the variables represent the selection or assignment of resources. For example, in a scheduling problem, a binary variable might be used to represent whether or not a particular machine is assigned to a particular task. In this case, a value of 0 would indicate that the machine is not assigned to the task, and a value of 1 would indicate that it is.</li>
<li>Binary variables can be included in optimization problems using a number of different modeling languages and software packages, such as AMPL, GAMS, and CPLEX. They are often used in conjunction with other types of variables, such as continuous or integer variables, to model more complex optimization problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chance-constraint">Chance constraint</h3>
<ul>
<li>A chance constraint is a type of constraint that is used in optimization problems to ensure that a certain probability is achieved. In a chance constraint, the constraint is expressed in terms of a probability, and the solution to the optimization problem must satisfy the constraint with a certain probability, which is usually specified in advance.</li>
<li>Chance constraints are often used in optimization problems to model uncertainty or risk. For example, in a transportation optimization problem, a chance constraint might be used to ensure that a certain percentage of shipments arrive at their destination on time. In this case, the probability would represent the likelihood that a shipment will arrive on time, and the constraint would specify the minimum acceptable probability.</li>
<li>Chance constraints can be difficult to handle in optimization problems, because they introduce a probabilistic element that is not present in traditional constraints. As a result, special techniques are often needed to solve optimization problems with chance constraints, such as Monte Carlo simulation or approximation methods.</li>

<h3 id="clique">Clique</h3>
<ul>
<li>In graph theory, a clique is a subset of vertices in an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent, that is, they are connected by an edge. A clique is said to be maximal if it is not a subset of any other clique in the graph.</li>
<li>Cliques have a number of interesting properties and have been studied extensively in the field of graph theory. For example, it is easy to determine whether a given set of vertices forms a clique, and it is also easy to find the maximum size of a clique in a given graph.</li>
<li>Cliques have a wide range of applications in computer science and other fields. They are often used in network analysis to identify groups of nodes that are highly connected, and they have also been used in machine learning and data mining to identify patterns and trends in data.</li>

<h3 id="constraint">Constraint</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of optimization, a constraint is a condition that must be satisfied by the solution to a problem.

<li>Constraints can be expressed in a variety of ways, depending on the type of optimization problem being solved. In linear programming, for example, constraints are typically expressed as linear inequalities or equations. In nonlinear programming, constraints can be expressed as nonlinear functions.</li>
<li>Constraints play a central role in optimization problems, as they help to define the space of possible solutions and the objective that the optimization algorithm is trying to maximize or minimize. Constraints can be used to represent a wide range of requirements and limitations, including capacity limits, resource availability, and physical laws.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="convex-function">Convex function</h3>
<ul>
<li>In mathematics, a convex function is a function that is always above its tangent lines. Equivalently, a convex function is a function for which the line segment connecting any two points on the graph of the function lies below the graph.</li>

Convex optimization problems can be formulated and solved in a variety of ways. They can be expressed as linear programming problems, quadratic programming problems, second-order cone programming problems, and semidefinite programming problems, among others.</li>
<li>One of the key features of convex optimization problems is that they have a unique global minimum, which can be found efficiently using algorithms such as gradient descent or interior point methods. Additionally, convex optimization problems satisfy strong duality, which means that the solution to the primal problem (the original optimization problem) can be obtained from the solution to the dual problem (a related optimization problem).</li>
<li>Convex optimization has a wide range of applications in fields such as machine learning, control engineering, and economics. It is used to solve problems such as training neural networks, designing control systems, and finding equilibrium in market models.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="convex-quadratic-function">Convex quadratic function</h3>
<ul>
<li>A convex quadratic function is a function of the form:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>f(x) = x^T Q x + q^T x + c
</code></pre><p>where Q is a symmetric matrix, q is a vector, and c is a scalar.</p>
<ul>
<li>The function f is convex if and only if Q is positive semidefinite, i.e., all of its eigenvalues are nonnegative. If Q is positive definite, then f is strictly convex, meaning that it has a unique global minimum.</li>
<li>Convex quadratic functions can be minimized using a variety of algorithms, such as gradient descent, Newton&rsquo;s method, and interior point methods. They are often used in convex optimization problems as a simple and efficient way to model objective functions or constraints.</li>
<li>Examples of convex quadratic functions include the negative log likelihood of a Gaussian distribution, the objective function of a least squares regression problem, and the objective function of a support vector machine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="convex-quadratic-program">Convex quadratic program</h3>
<ul>
<li>A convex quadratic program (CQP) is an optimization problem of the form:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>minimize x^T Q x + q^T x
subject to Ax &lt;= b
l &lt;= x &lt;= u
</code></pre><p>where x is the optimization variable, Q is a symmetric matrix, q is a vector, A is a matrix, b is a vector, l is a vector of lower bounds on x, and u is a vector of upper bounds on x.</p>
<ul>
<li>The objective function f(x) = x^T Q x + q^T x is a convex quadratic function, and the feasible region defined by Ax &lt;= b and l &lt;= x &lt;= u is a convex set. Therefore, the problem is a convex optimization problem.</li>
<li>CQPs can be solved using a variety of algorithms, such as gradient descent, Newton&rsquo;s method, and interior point methods. They are often used to model problems in fields such as machine learning, control engineering, and economics.</li>
<li>Examples of CQPs include the problem of training a support vector machine, the problem of designing a linear controller, and the problem of finding an equilibrium in a market model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="convex-set">Convex set</h3>
<ul>
<li>A convex set is a subset of a vector space that contains all the points on the line segments connecting any two of its points. Equivalently, a set is convex if for any two points x and y in the set and for any scalar t in the interval [0, 1], the point (1 - t)x + ty is also in the set.</li>
<li>Convex sets have several useful properties. For example, if a function is defined on a convex set and is minimized over that set, then it has a unique global minimum. Additionally, the intersection of any two convex sets is convex, and the convex hull of any set is convex.</li>
<li>Convex sets are important in optimization because many optimization problems can be formulated as minimizing a function over a convex set. Such problems are called convex optimization problems, and they can be solved efficiently using algorithms such as gradient descent or interior point methods.</li>
<li>Examples of convex sets include the set of all points in a plane that are contained in a circle, the set of all positive semidefinite matrices, and the set of all points in a Euclidean space that satisfy a system of linear inequalities.</li>

<li>The diet problem is a classic example of a linear programming problem, which is a type of optimization problem. It involves finding the optimal combination of foods to consume in order to meet certain nutritional requirements at the lowest cost.</li>
<li>The diet problem can be formulated as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>minimize c^T x
subject to Ax &lt;= b
x &gt;= 0
</code></pre><p>where x is a vector of decision variables representing the amounts of each food to consume, c is a vector of costs per unit of each food, A is a matrix representing the nutritional content of each food, and b is a vector representing the required intake of each nutrient.</p>
<ul>
<li>The objective is to minimize the total cost of the diet, subject to the constraints that the nutritional requirements are met.</li>
<li>The diet problem can be solved using linear programming techniques, such as the simplex algorithm or the interior point method. It has applications in fields such as nutrition, public health, and economics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic programming</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic programming is a method for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems in a table or array. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to obtain the solution to the original problem.</li>
<li>Dynamic programming is particularly useful for problems that exhibit the following two properties:
<ul>
<li>Optimal substructure: The optimal solution to a problem can be obtained by combining the optimal solutions to its subproblems.</li>
<li>Overlapping subproblems: Many of the subproblems in the problem are identical, or &ldquo;overlap,&rdquo; meaning that they can be solved just once and the solution can be reused many times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dynamic programming algorithms are typically implemented using recursion, and they can be either top-down (starting with the original problem and breaking it down into subproblems) or bottom-up (starting with the subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem).</li>
<li>Examples of problems that can be solved using dynamic programming include the knapsack problem, the shortest path problem, and the longest common subsequence problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="edge">Edge</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of machine learning, an edge refers to the boundary between different classes or clusters in a dataset. For example, in a classification problem, an edge may represent the boundary between different categories of data points, such as between points that belong to the &ldquo;positive&rdquo; class and points that belong to the &ldquo;negative&rdquo; class.</li>
<li>Edges can be used to inform the design of machine learning models, particularly in the context of supervised learning. For example, a model that is designed to classify data points into different categories might use edges to define the decision boundaries between classes. In this case, the model would aim to find a line or curve that maximally separates the points in one class from those in another class.</li>
<li>Edges can also be used as features in machine learning models. For example, in a computer vision problem, edges in an image might be used as input to a model that is designed to classify objects in the image.</li>
<li>Overall, the concept of an edge is important in machine learning because it represents the separation between different classes or clusters of data, and this separation can be used to inform the design and behavior of machine learning models.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feasible-solution">Feasible solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>A feasible solution to an optimization problem is a solution that satisfies all of the constraints of the problem. In other words, it is a solution that lies within the feasible region defined by the constraints.</li>
<li>For example, consider the following linear programming problem:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>minimize c^T x
subject to Ax &lt;= b
x &gt;= 0
</code></pre><ul>
<li>In this problem, x is the optimization variable, and the constraints Ax &lt;= b and x &gt;= 0 define the feasible region. A feasible solution is a vector x that lies within this region, i.e., it satisfies the constraints Ax &lt;= b and x &gt;= 0.</li>
<li>Feasible solutions are important in optimization because they represent the set of possible solutions to the problem. The goal of an optimization algorithm is to find the optimal solution, which is the feasible solution that minimizes (or maximizes) the objective function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixed-charge">Fixed charge</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of optimization, a fixed charge is a cost that is independent of the decision variables and is not included in the objective function. Instead, it is treated as a constraint on the problem.</li>
<li>For example, consider the following linear programming problem:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>minimize c^T x
subject to Ax &lt;= b
x &gt;= 0
F(x) &lt;= f
</code></pre><ul>
<li>In this problem, x is the optimization variable, c is a vector of costs per unit of each decision variable, and Ax &lt;= b and x &gt;= 0 define the feasible region. The constraint F(x) &lt;= f represents a fixed charge on the problem.</li>
<li>Fixed charges are important in optimization because they can represent costs or constraints that are not captured by the objective function or the constraints on the decision variables. For example, a fixed charge might represent a budget constraint, a regulatory requirement, or a capacity constraint.</li>
<li>Optimization algorithms can be used to find the optimal solution to a problem with fixed charges by taking these constraints into account. The optimal solution is the feasible solution that minimizes (or maximizes) the objective function subject to all of the constraints on the problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flow">Flow</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of optimization, flow typically refers to the movement of goods, resources, or people from one location to another. Optimization problems that involve flow often involve finding the optimal allocation of resources or the optimal path for goods or people to follow.</li>
<li>Examples of optimization problems that involve flow include network flow problems, transportation problems, and logistics problems. These problems can be formulated as linear programming problems, integer programming problems, or network flow problems, depending on the specifics of the problem.</li>
<li>In a network flow problem, the goal is to find the optimal flow of goods or resources through a network of nodes and edges, subject to capacity constraints on the edges and demand or supply constraints at the nodes. In a transportation problem, the goal is to find the optimal allocation of goods from a set of sources to a set of destinations, subject to capacity constraints on the transportation vehicles and demand constraints at the destinations. In a logistics problem, the goal is to find the optimal route or schedule for moving goods from one location to another, subject to time and resource constraints.</li>
<li>Overall, the concept of flow is important in optimization because it represents the movement of goods, resources, or people, and the optimization of this flow can lead to improved efficiency and cost savings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="global-optimummaximumminimum">Global optimum/maximum/minimum</h3>
<ul>
<li>The global optimum (or global maximum or minimum, depending on the context) of a function is the point at which the function achieves its highest (or lowest) value. For a function defined over a continuous domain, the global optimum is the point at which the function has a local minimum (or maximum) and there are no other points with a lower (or higher) value.</li>
<li>In optimization, the goal is often to find the global optimum of an objective function subject to certain constraints. For example, in a linear programming problem, the goal is to find the point at which the objective function is minimized (or maximized) subject to a set of linear constraints. In this case, the global optimum is the point at which the objective function has the lowest (or highest) value among all points that satisfy the constraints.</li>
<li>The global optimum is important because it represents the best possible solution to an optimization problem. In contrast, a local optimum is a point at which the objective function has a local minimum (or maximum) but may not be the global optimum.</li>
<li>The global optimum can be found using a variety of optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, Newton&rsquo;s method, and interior point methods. These algorithms can be used to find the global optimum of a wide range of optimization problems, including linear programming problems, nonlinear programming problems, and convex optimization problems.</li>

<li>A graph is a mathematical structure used to represent relationships between objects. It consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges connecting the vertices.</li>
<li>The vertices in a graph represent the objects, and the edges represent the relationships between the objects. The edges can be directed (meaning that they have a specific starting and ending vertex) or undirected (meaning that they do not have a specific direction).</li>
<li>Graphs are commonly used to represent networks, such as social networks, transportation networks, and communication networks. They are also used to represent data structures, such as trees and maps, and to model optimization problems, such as the shortest path problem and the traveling salesman problem.</li>
<li>There are many different types of graphs, including directed graphs, undirected graphs, weighted graphs (where the edges have weights or costs associated with them), and bipartite graphs (where the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets and the edges only connect vertices in different sets).</li>
<li>Overall, the concept of a graph is a fundamental one in mathematics and computer science, and it has many applications in fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and operations research.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="initialization">Initialization</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of optimization, initialization refers to the process of setting the initial values of the decision variables or other parameters of the optimization algorithm. These initial values are used to begin the optimization process, and they can have a significant impact on the convergence and performance of the algorithm.</li>
<li>The choice of initial values can depend on the specific optimization problem being solved and the optimization algorithm being used. For example, in a gradient descent algorithm, the initial values of the decision variables might be set to random values or to the solution of a related optimization problem. In an interior point algorithm, the initial values of the decision variables and the algorithm parameters might be chosen based on the properties of the problem, such as the condition number of the constraint matrix.</li>
<li>Initialization is important in optimization because it can affect the convergence and performance of the algorithm. Careful initialization can help to ensure that the algorithm converges to a good solution and does not get stuck in a local minimum (or maximum). On the other hand, poor initialization can lead to slow convergence or failure to find the optimal solution.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integer-program">Integer program</h3>
<ul>
<li>An integer program is an optimization problem in which some or all of the decision variables are required to be integers. Integer programming problems are often used to model problems that involve discrete choices or decisions, such as the selection of a set of products to manufacture or the allocation of resources to different projects.</li>
<li>Integer programming problems can be formulated in a variety of ways, depending on the specific constraints and objective of the problem. For example, a common form of integer programming problem is the linear integer programming problem, which has the following form:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>minimize c^T x
subject to Ax &lt;= b
x &gt;= 0
x is integer
</code></pre><ul>
<li>In this problem, x is the optimization variable, and c is a vector of costs per unit of each decision variable. The constraints Ax &lt;= b and x &gt;= 0 define the feasible region, and the constraint x is integer requires that the decision variables must be integers.</li>
<li>Integer programming problems can be difficult to solve, because the feasible region is typically discrete and may not be smooth or continuous. Specialized algorithms, such as branch and bound and cutting plane algorithms, can be used to solve integer programming problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linear-equation">Linear equation</h3>
<ul>
<li>A linear equation is an equation in which the highest power of the variable(s) is 1. For example, the equation y = 2x + 1 is a linear equation because the highest power of x is 1. Linear equations can take many forms, but they all have the property that the highest power of the variable(s) is 1.</li>
<li>Linear equations can be written in the standard form:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ax + by = c
</code></pre><p>where a and b are constants, and x and y are variables. The standard form of a linear equation is useful because it allows us to easily identify the slope and y-intercept of the line described by the equation. The slope of the line is represented by the coefficient of x (a), and the y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis (the value of y when x = 0), which is represented by the constant term (c).</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear equations can also be written in slope-intercept form:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>y = mx + b
</code></pre><p>where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. This form of the equation is useful when we want to find the equation of a line given its slope and y-intercept.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear equations can have one or more variables, and they can have any number of terms. For example, the equation 2x + 3y - 4z = 5 is a linear equation because the highest power of any of the variables (x, y, and z) is 1.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linear-function">Linear function</h3>
<ul>
<li>A linear function is a function of the form f(x) = mx + b, where x is the input variable and f(x) is the output variable. The constants m and b are called the slope and y-intercept of the function, respectively. The slope is a measure of how steep the line described by the function is, and the y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis (the value of f(x) when x = 0).</li>
<li>Linear functions have the property that the graph of the function is a straight line. The slope of the line is determined by the value of m, and the y-intercept is determined by the value of b. For example, the function f(x) = 2x + 1 has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of (0, 1).</li>

<li>Linear inequalities can be represented in one of two ways: in standard form or in slope-intercept form. In standard form, a linear inequality is written as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ax + by &gt; c

or

ax + by &lt; c

or

ax + by ≥ c

or

ax + by ≤ c
</code></pre><p>where a, b, and c are constants and x and y are variables. The standard form of a linear inequality is useful because it allows us to easily identify the slope and y-intercept of the line described by the inequality.</p>

<li>In slope-intercept form, a linear inequality is written as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>y &gt; mx + b

or

y &lt; mx + b
</code></pre><p>where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. This form of the inequality is useful when we want to find the inequality that defines a particular region of the coordinate plane.</p>
<ul>
<li>The solution to a linear inequality is the set of all points that satisfy the inequality. The graph of a linear inequality is a region of the coordinate plane that includes all of the points that satisfy the inequality. The graph of a linear inequality is often represented by shading the region of the coordinate plane that satisfies the inequality.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="local-optimummaximumminimum">Local optimum/maximum/minimum</h3>
<ul>
<li>A local optimum, maximum, or minimum is a point in a function where the function has a locally best value. In other words, it is a point where the function has a value that is better than the values of the function in the immediate vicinity of the point.</li>
<li>For example, consider a function f(x) defined on the real numbers. If there exists a value x0 such that f(x0) is greater than or equal to f(x) for all x in a certain interval around x0, then x0 is a local maximum of the function. Similarly, if there exists a value x0 such that f(x0) is less than or equal to f(x) for all x in a certain interval around x0, then x0 is a local minimum of the function.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that a local optimum, maximum, or minimum is not necessarily the global optimum, maximum, or minimum of the function. The global optimum, maximum, or minimum is the point where the function has the best value over its entire domain. For example, if f(x) has a local maximum at x0, it does not necessarily mean that f(x0) is the highest possible value that the function can take on. It could be that there exists another point x1 where the function has an even higher value. In this case, x1 would be the global maximum of the function.</li>

<li>Another approach is to use robust optimization, which is a methodology that seeks to find solutions that are robust to uncertainty in the input data. Robust optimization involves optimizing an objective function that is a function of both the decision variables and the uncertain parameters, subject to constraints on both the decision variables and the uncertain parameters.</li>
<li>Uncertainty can be a challenging aspect of optimization because it can make it difficult to predict the behavior of the optimization problem and to determine the optimal solution. However, accounting for uncertainty in the optimization process can be important for modeling and solving real-world problems because it allows for the incorporation of variability and randomness into the optimization process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vertex">Vertex</h3>
<ul>
<li>In optimization, a vertex is a point on the feasible region of an optimization problem that satisfies all of the constraints of the problem. The feasible region is the set of points that satisfy the constraints of the problem, and a vertex is a point on the boundary of the feasible region.</li>
<li>In a linear programming problem, the feasible region is a polyhedron, and the vertices are the points where the constraints intersect. The optimal solution to the linear programming problem is either a vertex of the feasible region or a point on a constraint that is not a vertex.</li>
<li>In a nonlinear programming problem, the feasible region is a more complex shape, and the vertices may or may not be part of the optimal solution. The optimal solution to a nonlinear programming problem is typically found using algorithms such as gradient descent or conjugate gradient, which search for the optimal solution by moving from one point to another along the feasible region.</li>
<li>The vertices of the feasible region are important in optimization because they represent the extreme points of the region, and the optimal solution may be found at a vertex or along a constraint. Understanding the structure of the feasible region and the location of the vertices can be helpful for solving optimization problems.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="fifo">FIFO</h3>
<ul>
<li>FIFO stands for &ldquo;first-in, first-out.&rdquo; In probability-based models, FIFO is a queueing discipline that refers to the way in which items or entities are processed or served. Under a FIFO system, the first item that enters the queue is the first one to be served or processed. This is in contrast to other queueing disciplines, such as LIFO (last-in, first-out) or priority-based systems, in which the order of service or processing is determined by some other criterion.</li>
<li>In probability models, FIFO systems are often used to model real-world situations in which items are processed in the order in which they arrive. For example, a FIFO system might be used to model the way in which customers are served in a bank or a grocery store, where the first customer in line is the first one to be assisted.

<li>In Kendall notation, a system is represented by a graph, with the entities in the system represented as nodes, and the relationships between the entities represented as edges. The graph is then annotated with labels that describe the type of relationship that exists between the entities.</li>
<li>There are several types of labels that can be used in Kendall notation, including:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;m&rdquo; for a mutual relationship between two entities, in which each entity has an effect on the other</li>
<li>&ldquo;o&rdquo; for an one-way relationship, in which one entity has an effect on the other but not vice versa</li>
<li>&ldquo;r&rdquo; for a reciprocal relationship, in which two entities have an effect on each other but the effect is not necessarily equal</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lifo">LIFO</h3>
<ul>
<li>LIFO is an acronym for Last In, First Out, and is a method of organizing and manipulating data in a data structure such as a stack or queue.</li>
<li>In a LIFO data structure, the most recent item added to the structure is the first one to be removed. This is in contrast to a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure, in which the first item added is the first one to be removed.</li>
<li>LIFO data structures are often used in computing and programming because they are simple to implement and can be manipulated quickly and efficiently. An example of a LIFO data structure is a stack, which is a list of items that are added and removed in a specific order. When an item is added to the top of a stack, it is said to be &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; onto the stack. When an item is removed from the top of the stack, it is said to be &ldquo;popped&rdquo; off the stack.</li>

<h3 id="markov-chain">Markov chain</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Markov chain is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another according to certain probabilistic rules.

<ul>
<li>In the context of a probability-based model, a queue is a system in which items arrive at a certain rate and are processed or served at a different rate. The items that arrive and are waiting to be processed form a queue.</li>
<li>Queueing theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of queues and the systems that create them. It is used to model and analyze the performance of systems that involve waiting in line, such as call centers, computer networks, and manufacturing systems.</li>
<li>In a queueing model, the arrival rate of items and the processing rate of the system are important factors that determine the behavior of the queue. If the arrival rate is higher than the processing rate, the queue will grow over time, leading to an increase in waiting time for items. If the processing rate is higher than the arrival rate, the queue will shrink over time.</li>
<li>Queueing models can be used to analyze the performance of a system and to make predictions about the behavior of the queue under different conditions.

<ul>
<li>In a probability model, the service rate refers to the rate at which a system is able to process or serve items. The service rate is an important factor that determines the behavior of a queue or other system in which items are waiting to be processed.</li>
<li>In a queueing model, the service rate is typically represented as the average number of items that the system is able to process per unit of time. It is used to calculate the expected waiting time for items in the queue, as well as the probability of the queue being empty or full at a given time.</li>
<li>The service rate is often influenced by factors such as the number of servers or processing units available, the efficiency of the processing units, and the complexity of the tasks being performed. By adjusting the service rate, it is possible to optimize the performance of a system and to reduce the waiting time for items in the queue.</li>
<li>The service rate is typically contrasted with the arrival rate, which is the rate at which items arrive at the system and enter the queue. The relationship between the service rate and the arrival rate determines the behavior of the queue and the expected waiting time for items.</li>

<h3 id="steady-state">Steady state</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a system or process, the steady state is a condition in which the system is in a stable, equilibrium state and is not changing over time. In other words, the system has reached a state of balance and is no longer undergoing significant changes.</li>
<li>The concept of steady state is used in a variety of fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and biology. In physics and engineering, the steady state is often used to describe systems that are in a state of equilibrium and are not undergoing any net change, such as a fluid flowing through a pipe at a constant rate.

<li>The exponential distribution is a probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process, which is a process in which events occur independently at a constant average rate. It is a continuous distribution, meaning that the random variable can take on any value within a given range.</li>
<li>The exponential distribution is defined by a single parameter, lambda (λ), which represents the average rate at which events occur. The probability density function (PDF) of the exponential distribution is given by:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PDF(x) = λ * e^(-λx)
</code></pre><p>where x is the time between events and e is the base of the natural logarithm.</p>
<ul>
<li>The exponential distribution has the property that the time between events is exponentially distributed, meaning that the probability of an event occurring decreases exponentially as the time since the last event increases. This makes it a useful distribution for modeling processes in which the rate of occurrence decreases over time, such as the time between arrivals at a busy airport or the time between failures of a piece of equipment.</li>
<li>The exponential distribution is often used in reliability engineering and other fields to model the time between failures or other events of interest. It is also related to the Poisson distribution, which is a discrete distribution that describes the number of events in a given time period.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="geometric-distribution">Geometric distribution</h3>
<ul>
<li>The geometric distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of Bernoulli trials needed to get a single success. It is a discrete distribution, meaning that the random variable can only take on a finite number of values.</li>
<li>In the geometric distribution, there are two possible outcomes for each trial: success (denoted by a value of 1) or failure (denoted by a value of 0). The probability of success is denoted by p, and the probability of failure is denoted by (1-p).</li>
<li>The geometric distribution is defined by a single parameter, p, which represents the probability of success. The probability mass function (PMF) of the geometric distribution is given by:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PMF(x) = (1-p)^(x-1) * p
</code></pre><p>where x is the number of trials.</p>
<ul>
<li>The geometric distribution is often used to model the number of trials needed to get a single success in a series of independent events, such as the number of coin flips needed to get a heads or the number of times a die must be rolled to get a particular number. It is a useful distribution for modeling situations where there are only two possible outcomes and the probability of success decreases with each trial.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iid">IID</h3>
<ul>
<li>IID stands for &ldquo;independent and identically distributed.&rdquo; It is a term used to describe a sequence of random variables that are independent of each other and have the same probability distribution.</li>
<li>In other words, IID random variables are uncorrelated and have the same statistical properties. This means that the value of one random variable in the sequence does not affect the value of any other random variable in the sequence, and that the probability of any given value occurring is the same for all variables in the sequence.</li>
<li>IID random variables are often used in statistical analysis and probability theory, as they have a number of useful properties that make them easier to work with. For example, the expected value of the sum of IID random variables is equal to the sum of the expected values of the individual variables, which can simplify calculations.</li>
<li>IID random variables are used in a variety of fields, including statistics, economics, engineering, and computer science. They are commonly used to model the behavior of systems that involve uncertainty or randomness, such as financial markets or communication networks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lower-tail">Lower tail</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a probability distribution, the lower tail refers to the portion of the distribution that is below a certain value or threshold. The lower tail is often defined relative to a particular value, such as the mean or median of the distribution, and it represents the probability that a random variable will take on a value that is less than this threshold.</li>
<li>The lower tail of a distribution can be important in understanding the behavior of a random variable and in making predictions about its value. For example, in a financial context, the lower tail of a distribution may represent the probability of experiencing a significant loss or downturn.</li>
<li>The lower tail of a distribution can be characterized by various statistics, such as the lower quartile, which is the value below which 25% of the observations fall, or the lower decile, which is the value below which 10% of the observations fall. These statistics can provide insight into the skewness of the distribution and the relative frequency of lower values.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="memoryless-distribution">Memoryless (distribution)</h3>
<ul>
<li>A memoryless distribution is a type of probability distribution that has the property that the conditional probability of an event occurring at a future time is independent of the time that has elapsed since the last event. This means that the probability of an event occurring at a given time is the same as the probability of it occurring at any other time, regardless of how much time has passed since the last event.</li>
<li>An example of a memoryless distribution is the exponential distribution, which is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process. The exponential distribution has the property that the probability of an event occurring at a given time is the same as the probability of it occurring at any other time, regardless of how much time has passed since the last event.</li>
<li>Memoryless distributions are often used to model processes in which the probability of an event occurring does not depend on the time that has elapsed since the last event, such as the time between failures of a piece of equipment or the time between arrivals at a busy airport. They are useful for modeling systems in which the probability of an event occurring is constant over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="normal-distribution">Normal distribution</h3>
<ul>
<li>The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is widely used to model real-valued random variables. It is a symmetrical distribution with a bell-shaped curve and has a single peak, which is at the mean of the distribution.</li>
<li>The normal distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean, which is the average value of the distribution, and the standard deviation, which is a measure of the spread of the distribution. The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution is given by:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PDF(x) = (1 / (sqrt(2*π)σ)) * e^(-(x-μ)^2 / (2σ^2))
</code></pre><p>where x is the value of the random variable, μ is the mean of the distribution, σ is the standard deviation, and π is approximately 3.14.</p>
<ul>
<li>The normal distribution is often used to model variables that are continuous and have a symmetrical distribution, such as height, weight, and IQ scores. It is a useful distribution because it has a number of desirable properties, such as being stable under linear transformations and having a simple analytical form. It is also commonly used in statistical analysis and probability theory.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="poisson-distribution">Poisson distribution</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of events that occur in a given time period, such as the number of phone calls received by a call center or the number of defects in a manufactured product. It is often used to model the number of times an event occurs in a fixed interval of time, space, or volume.</li>
<li>The Poisson distribution is defined by a single parameter, lambda (λ), which represents the average rate at which events occur. The probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PMF(x) = (λ^x * e^(-λ)) / x!
</code></pre><p>where x is the number of events and e is the base of the natural logarithm.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Poisson distribution has the property that the probability of observing a given number of events decreases exponentially as the number of events increases. This makes it a useful distribution for modeling processes in which the rate of occurrence decreases as the number of events increases, such as the number of errors in a document or the number of vehicles arriving at a traffic light.</li>
<li>The Poisson distribution is often used in fields such as engineering, economics, and operations research to model the occurrence of events over time or space. It is related to the exponential distribution, which is a continuous distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-q-plot">Q-Q plot</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a graphical tool used to assess whether two data sets come from the same distribution. It is a scatter plot that plots the quantiles of one data set against the quantiles of another data set, and it is used to visualize the similarity or dissimilarity between the two distributions.</li>
<li>To create a Q-Q plot, the data is first sorted in ascending order and then divided into equal-sized groups, called quantiles. The quantiles of each data set are then plotted against each other on the graph. If the two data sets come from the same distribution, the points on the Q-Q plot will fall along a straight line. If the distributions are different, the points will deviate from the line.</li>
<li>Q-Q plots are often used in statistical analysis to compare the distributions of two data sets or to assess whether a data set follows a particular distribution. They are also useful for identifying outliers and assessing the normality of a data set.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tails">Tail(s)</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a probability distribution, the tails refer to the portion of the distribution that is above or below a certain value or threshold. The tails of a distribution can be characterized by various statistics, such as the upper and lower quartiles or deciles, which are values above or below which a certain percentage of the observations fall.</li>
<li>The tails of a distribution can be important in understanding the behavior of a random variable and in making predictions about its value. For example, in a financial context, the tails of a distribution may represent the probability of experiencing a significant gain or loss.</li>
<li>The tails of a distribution can also be used to characterize the skewness of the distribution. A distribution with a long left tail (i.e., a tail that extends to the left of the mean) is said to be left-skewed, while a distribution with a long right tail is said to be right-skewed. A symmetrical distribution, on the other hand, has equal tails on both sides of the mean.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="upper-tail">Upper tail</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a probability distribution, the upper tail refers to the portion of the distribution that is above a certain value or threshold. The upper tail is often defined relative to a particular value, such as the mean or median of the distribution, and it represents the probability that a random variable will take on a value that is greater than this threshold.</li>
<li>The upper tail of a distribution can be important in understanding the behavior of a random variable and in making predictions about its value. For example, in a financial context, the upper tail of a distribution may represent the probability of experiencing a significant gain or upturn.</li>
<li>The upper tail of a distribution can be characterized by various statistics, such as the upper quartile, which is the value above which 25% of the observations fall, or the upper decile, which is the value above which 10% of the observations fall. These statistics can provide insight into the skewness of the distribution and the relative frequency of higher values.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weibull-distribution">Weibull distribution</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Weibull distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is often used to model the time it takes for a failure to occur in a system or the time between events in a process. It is a flexible distribution that can take on a variety of shapes, including a bell-shaped curve similar to the normal distribution, a curve with a long tail to the right (similar to the exponential distribution), or a curve with a long tail to the left (similar to the log-normal distribution).</li>
<li>The Weibull distribution is defined by two parameters: alpha (α), which determines the shape of the distribution, and beta (β), which determines the scale of the distribution. The probability density function (PDF) of the Weibull distribution is given by:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PDF(x) = (α / β) * (x / β)^(α-1) * e^(-(x/β)^α)
</code></pre><p>where x is the value of the random variable.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Weibull distribution is often used in reliability engineering and other fields to model the time to failure of a system or the time between events. It is a useful distribution because it can take on a variety of shapes, making it suitable for modeling a wide range of phenomena. It is also commonly used in statistical analysis and probability theory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="regression">Regression</h2>
<h3 id="adjusted-r-squaredadjusted-r2">Adjusted R-squared/Adjusted R2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted R-squared is a statistic that attempts to adjust the R-squared value for the number of predictors in a regression model. It is often used to determine whether the addition of new predictors to a model significantly improves the model&rsquo;s ability to predict the response variable.</li>
<li>R-squared is a measure of how well a model fits the data. It is calculated as the proportion of the variance in the response variable that is explained by the model. However, R-squared can sometimes be artificially inflated when adding additional predictors to the model, even if those predictors do not significantly improve the model&rsquo;s ability to predict the response.</li>
<li>Adjusted R-squared is calculated by taking into account the number of predictors in the model and the sample size. It adjusts the R-squared value downward to account for the addition of predictors that do not significantly improve the model.</li>
<li>In general, a higher adjusted R-squared value indicates a better fit for the model. However, it is important to consider other evaluation metrics in addition to adjusted R-squared when assessing the performance of a regression model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="area-under-curveauc">Area under curve/AUC</h3>
<ul>
<li>The area under the curve (AUC) is a measure of the performance of a binary classifier, such as a diagnostic test. It represents the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative example.</li>
<li>The AUC can be calculated from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various classification thresholds. The AUC is the area under the ROC curve.</li>
<li>AUC values range from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better performing classifier. An AUC of 0.5 indicates that the classifier is no better than random guessing, while an AUC of 1 indicates perfect classification.</li>
<li>The AUC is a useful evaluation metric because it is independent of the classification threshold and is not sensitive to the imbalance in the class distribution. It is often used in medical research to evaluate the performance of diagnostic tests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bayesian-regression">Bayesian regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bayesian regression is a type of regression analysis that is based on Bayesian statistics. In Bayesian regression, model parameters are considered random variables, and a probability distribution is assigned to each parameter.</li>
<li>In contrast to traditional regression, where the values of the model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian regression involves estimating the posterior distribution of the model parameters given the data and a prior distribution. This posterior distribution represents the updated belief about the model parameters after taking into account the observed data.</li>
<li>One advantage of Bayesian regression is that it allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge or beliefs about the model parameters into the analysis. It also provides a full probability distribution for the model parameters, which can be useful for making predictions and for understanding the uncertainty in the estimates.</li>
<li>Bayesian regression can be implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques or variational inference methods. It is often used in situations where the number of predictors is large or when there is limited data available.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="box-cox-transformation">Box-Cox transformation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Box-Cox transformation is a way to transform non-normal dependent variables into a normal shape. Normality is an assumption for many statistical techniques, so being able to transform a non-normal dependent variable into a normal shape can be useful for the purposes of analysis. The Box-Cox transformation is defined as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Y = (X^lambda - 1) / lambda
</code></pre><p>where X is the variable to be transformed, Y is the transformed variable, and lambda is a parameter that you can choose to optimize the transformation. If lambda is equal to 0, the transformation becomes the natural logarithm. If lambda is equal to 1, the transformation is the identity transformation (i.e., the variable is left unchanged).</p>
<ul>
<li>The Box-Cox transformation is often used in regression analysis, particularly when the dependent variable is not normal. It can be used to stabilize the variance of the dependent variable, improve the linearity of the model, and/or meet the assumptions of normality.</li>
<li>It is important to note that the Box-Cox transformation is only appropriate for continuous variables. If you have a categorical variable, you should not use the Box-Cox transformation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="branching">Branching</h3>
<p>In the context of machine learning, branching can be used to create decision trees, which are a type of model used for classification and regression tasks. A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature (an attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the input data by recursive partitioning.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a decision tree in Python using the scikit-learn library:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from sklearn import tree

# features (X) and labels (y)
X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
y = [0, 1]

# create the decision tree model
model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()

# train the model
model.fit(X, y)

# predict a label for a new sample
print(model.predict([[2., 2.]]))
</code></pre><ul>

# predict a label for a new sample
print(model.predict([[2., 2.]]))
</code></pre><ul>
<li>In this example, the decision tree will learn to predict a label (0 or 1) based on the input features (X). The tree will create branches based on the conditions specified in the decision rules, and the leaves of the tree will contain the predicted labels. Decision trees are a simple and powerful tool for many machine learning tasks, and they can be used in a variety of applications such as recommendation systems, fraud detection, and image classification.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cart">CART</h3>
<ul>
<li>CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is a decision tree algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is a popular algorithm for building decision trees because it is simple to understand and implement, and it can handle both continuous and categorical variables.</li>
<li>In a CART decision tree, the tree is built by selecting splits on the features that maximize the reduction in impurity. Impurity refers to the amount of uncertainty or randomness in the data. The goal of the algorithm is to create splits that reduce the impurity of the data as much as possible, resulting in purer leaves (i.e., leaves with a single class or value).</li>
<li>Here is an example of a CART decision tree in Python using the scikit-learn library:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from sklearn import tree

# features (X) and labels (y)
X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]

# train the model
model.fit(X, y)

# predict a label for a new sample
print(model.predict([[2., 2.]]))
</code></pre><ul>
<li>In this example, the CART model will learn to predict a label (0 or 1) based on the input features (X). The tree will create splits based on the Gini impurity criterion, and the leaves of the tree will contain the predicted labels.

</ul>
<h3 id="classification-tree">Classification tree</h3>

<li>The topmost node in a classification tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the input data by recursive partitioning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="concordance-index">Concordance index</h3>
<ul>
<li>A concordance index (also known as the c-index) is a measure of the predictive ability of a binary classifier. It is calculated as the fraction of all pairs of samples (one positive, one negative) where the positive sample has a higher predicted probability of being positive than the negative sample. The c-index ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect prediction and a value of 0 indicates no predictive ability. The c-index is often used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, particularly in the field of medical statistics.</li>
<li>Here is an example of how to calculate the c-index in Python:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>import numpy as np

# true labels (y_true) and predicted probabilities (y_pred)
y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0.1, 0.8, 0.7, 0.2, 0.9]

# calculate the c-index
c_index = 0
for i in range(len(y_true)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(y_true)):
        if (y_true[i] == 0 and y_true[j] == 1) or (y_true[i] == 1 and y_true[j] == 0):
            c_index += (y_pred[i] &gt; y_pred[j]) + (y_pred[i] == y_pred[j])
print(c_index / (len(y_true) * (len(y_true) - 1) / 2))
</code></pre><h3 id="decision-tree">Decision tree</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="elastic-net">Elastic net</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elastic Net is a linear regression model that combines the penalties of both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. It is trained with both L1 and L2 regularization, and the mixing parameter alpha determines the weighting between the two. When alpha=0, Elastic Net is equivalent to Ridge Regression, and when alpha=1, it is equivalent to Lasso Regression.</li>
<li>The advantage of Elastic Net over Ridge Regression is that it is able to handle correlated features better, and the advantage over Lasso is that it does not require the features to be standardized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="forest">Forest</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of regression, a decision tree forest is a type of ensemble model that is made up of a collection of decision trees trained on different subsets of the training data. The individual decision trees in the forest make predictions based on the features in the data, and the predictions of the trees are combined to make the final prediction for the forest.</li>
<li>There are several ways to combine the predictions of the individual trees in the forest. One common method is to take the mean of the predictions of all the trees in the forest. Another method is to have each tree vote on the final prediction, and the most popular prediction is chosen as the output of the forest.</li>
<li>Decision tree forests are often used for regression tasks because they can handle high-dimensional data and are resistant to overfitting. They are also able to handle missing values in the data, which is a common problem in real-world datasets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interaction-term">Interaction term</h3>
<ul>
<li>An interaction term is a term in a statistical model that represents the effect of two variables on an outcome, rather than the effect of each variable individually. Interaction terms allow you to determine whether the relationship between two variables and the outcome is different from the individual relationships of each variable with the outcome.</li>
<li>For example, let&rsquo;s say you are studying the relationship between income, education, and happiness. You might include an interaction term in your model to test whether the relationship between income and happiness is different for people with different levels of education. If you find a significant interaction term, it suggests that the relationship between income and happiness is not the same for all levels of education.</li>
<li>In a statistical model, interaction terms are included as additional predictors along with the main effects (individual variables). They are usually represented by the product of the two variables that are being interacted. For example, if you are including an interaction term between variables X and Y, it would be represented as X*Y in the model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="𝑘-nearest-neighbor-regression">𝑘-Nearest-Neighbor regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) regression is a simple and easy-to-implement machine learning method used for regression tasks. In k-NN regression, the prediction for a given data point is based on the mean of the target values of the k nearest neighbors to that data point.</li>
<li>To make a prediction for a new data point, the distance between that point and all the other points in the training set is calculated. The k points in the training set that are closest to the new point are then identified, and the mean of the target values of these k points is taken as the prediction for the new point.</li>
<li>One of the main advantages of k-NN regression is that it is a non-parametric method, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying functional form of the data. This makes it well-suited for working with complex, non-linear relationships in the data. However, k-NN regression can be computationally expensive and may not be suitable for very large datasets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="knot">Knot</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of a spline, a knot is a point where the function changes curvature. A spline is a piecewise continuous curve that is used to approximate a set of data points, and knots are used to control the smoothness of the curve.</li>
<li>For example, consider a set of data points that show the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales at a store. A spline with a single knot would be a simple curve that passes through all the data points, while a spline with multiple knots would have a more complex shape that is able to better capture the underlying pattern in the data. The position and number of knots in the spline can be chosen to trade off between smoothness and fit to the data.</li>
<li>In general, splines are used to smooth noisy data or to fit a curve to a set of data points when a parametric form for the curve is not known. They are commonly used in regression and smoothing applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lasso-regression">Lasso regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lasso regression is a linear regression method that uses L1 regularization to encourage sparsity in the model. L1 regularization is a form of regularization that adds a penalty term to the objective function of the model based on the absolute values of the model coefficients. The penalty term is controlled by a hyperparameter alpha, which determines the strength of the regularization.</li>
<li>Lasso regression has the effect of driving some of the coefficients of the model to zero, effectively removing the corresponding features from the model. This can be useful for feature selection, as it allows you to identify the most important features in the data and remove the rest.</li>
<li>Lasso regression is particularly well-suited for cases where there are a large number of features and only a few of them are truly relevant. It is also useful when the relationships between the features and the outcome are sparse, i.e., when most of the features have little or no effect on the outcome. However, Lasso regression can be sensitive to the scale of the features, and it is generally recommended to standardize the features before fitting a Lasso model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="leaf">Leaf</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of a decision tree, a leaf is a terminal node that does not have any children. In a decision tree for regression, the value stored at a leaf node is the mean of the target values of the training examples that reach that leaf.</li>
<li>For example, consider a decision tree for predicting the price of a house based on features such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the location. The tree might have a leaf node for houses with three bedrooms that are located in a certain neighborhood. The value stored at this leaf node would be the mean of the prices of all the houses with three bedrooms in that neighborhood in the training set.</li>
<li>When making a prediction for a new house using the decision tree, the tree is traversed from the root to a leaf node based on the feature values of the new house. The value stored at the leaf node is then taken as the prediction for the house. Decision trees are often used for regression tasks because they are able to handle high-dimensional data and can handle missing values in the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linear-regression">Linear regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line to a set of data points, where the best-fitting line is one that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the true values.</li>
<li>Linear regression models can be represented by the equation:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bn*xn
</code></pre><p>where y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, &hellip;, xn are the independent variables, and b0, b1, b2, &hellip;, bn are the coefficients that represent the strength and direction of the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable. The coefficients are determined by fitting the model to the training data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear regression is a simple and widely-used method for modeling linear relationships in data. It is well-suited for cases where the relationship between the variables is well-approximated by a straight line. However, it is not capable of modeling more complex, non-linear relationships.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="logistic-regression">Logistic regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Logistic regression is a statistical method used for classification tasks. It is a supervised learning algorithm that takes a set of input features and uses them to predict a binary outcome (0 or 1).</li>
<li>The predictions of a logistic regression model are based on the probability of the positive class (class 1). The probability is computed using the logistic function, which maps any real-valued number to the range [0, 1]. The logistic function has the following form:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>p = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
</code></pre><p>where p is the probability of the positive class and z is a linear combination of the input features and the model coefficients.</p>
<ul>
<li>To make a prediction for a new data point, the model computes the probability of the positive class using the logistic function, and the predicted class is 1 if the probability is greater than or equal to 0.5 and 0 otherwise.</li>
<li>Logistic regression is widely used in a variety of applications, including image classification, spam filtering, and predicting customer churn. It is simple to implement and efficient to train, and it can be extended to handle multi-class classification tasks by using one-vs-rest or one-vs-all approaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="logit-model">Logit model</h3>
<ul>
<li>A logit model is a type of statistical model that is used for binary classification tasks. It is a type of generalized linear model that uses the logit function as the link function and the binary outcome as the dependent variable.</li>
<li>The logit function is a transformation of the probability of the positive class (class 1) into the real line. It is defined as the natural logarithm of the odds ratio:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>logit(p) = ln(p / (1 - p))
</code></pre><p>where p is the probability of the positive class. The logit function maps any probability value in the range [0, 1] to the range (-infinity, infinity).</p>
<ul>
<li>In a logit model, the predicted probability of the positive class is computed using the logit function and a linear combination of the input features and the model coefficients. The predicted class is then obtained by thresholding the probability at 0.5: class 1 if the probability is greater than or equal to 0.5 and class 0 otherwise.</li>
<li>Logit models are widely used in a variety of applications, including image classification, spam filtering, and predicting customer churn. They are simple to implement and efficient to train, and they can be extended to handle multi-class classification tasks by using one-vs-rest or one-vs-all approaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multi-adaptive-regression-splines-mars">Multi-adaptive regression splines (MARS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multi-adaptive regression splines (MARS) is a non-parametric regression technique that uses a combination of linear and non-linear basis functions to model complex relationships between the predictor and response variables.</li>
<li>MARS uses a forward-stepwise algorithm to add or remove basis functions, and adaptively adjust the model complexity to fit the data. The technique is particularly useful for handling non-linear and non-monotonic relationships, and can handle high-dimensional data with many predictor variables.</li>
<li>MARS is an alternative to traditional linear regression and other non-parametric techniques such as decision trees and random forests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="p-value">p-value</h3>
<ul>
<li>A p-value is a probability value that is used in statistical hypothesis testing to determine the significance of a sample&rsquo;s results. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. The smaller the p-value, the more evidence there is against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative hypothesis.</li>
<li>A common threshold for the p-value is 0.05, meaning that if the p-value is less than 0.05, the results are considered statistically significant and the null hypothesis is rejected. This means that there is less than a 5% chance that the results are due to chance. However, it is important to note that a p-value of less than 0.05 does not necessarily mean that the results are true or that the alternative hypothesis is correct, it just means that the results are unlikely to have occurred by chance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="p-value-fishing">p-value fishing</h3>
<ul>
<li>P-value fishing, also known as &ldquo;data dredging&rdquo; or &ldquo;p-hacking,&rdquo; refers to the practice of manipulating data, or selectively reporting results, in order to achieve a desired p-value. This can be done by, for example, selecting a subset of data, changing the parameters of a test, or repeating a test multiple times until a &ldquo;significant&rdquo; result is obtained.</li>
<li>P-value fishing can lead to false positive results, and increase the risk of type I errors (i.e. rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true). It can also inflate the false positive rate and decrease the statistical power of a study. It is considered a serious violation of scientific integrity and can lead to unreliable or misleading conclusions.</li>
<li>To avoid p-value fishing, it is recommended to pre-register study hypotheses, designs, and analysis plans before collecting any data, and to use appropriate multiple testing correction methods, such as the Bonferroni correction, to account for the number of tests performed and control the false positive rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="poisson-regression">Poisson regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Poisson regression is a statistical method used to model count data, such as the number of occurrences of an event over a period of time. Poisson regression is a type of generalized linear model (GLM) that assumes that the response variable follows a Poisson distribution, which is a discrete probability distribution used to model the number of times an event occurs in a fixed interval of time or space.</li>
<li>In Poisson regression, the response variable is modeled as a function of one or more predictor variables, using a log-linear relationship. The model is specified by a probability density function (pdf) of the form:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>λ = e^(β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... + βk*xk)
</code></pre><p>Where λ is the expected value of the response variable, x1, x2, &hellip;, xk are the predictor variables, and β0, β1, β2, &hellip;, βk are the parameters of the model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Poisson regression can be used to analyze count data with one or more predictor variables, and can handle over-dispersion, which is a common feature of count data, and can estimate the relative risk ratio and the incidence rate ratio. Poisson regression can also be extended to handle more complex data structures, such as clustered data, and can be used to model both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pruning">Pruning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pruning is a technique used in decision tree learning and other machine learning algorithms, to reduce the size of the tree and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures noise in the training data, which leads to poor generalization performance on unseen data. Pruning is a method to improve the generalization of decision tree by removing branches that do not contribute much to the classification or regression task.</li>
<li>There are two main types of pruning techniques: Reduced Error Pruning and Cost Complexity Pruning.</li>
<li>Reduced Error Pruning, also known as &ldquo;Reduced Error Pruning&rdquo; or &ldquo;Minimum Description Length Pruning&rdquo; (MDL) starts from the bottom of the tree and moves up, removing a node if it does not improve the classification accuracy.</li>
<li>Cost Complexity Pruning, also known as &ldquo;Weakest Link Pruning&rdquo; or &ldquo;Minimum Description Length Pruning&rdquo; (MDL) is based on a trade-off between the complexity of the tree and the accuracy of the tree. It involves adding a complexity parameter to the tree, which penalizes the number of nodes in the tree, and then prunes the tree by minimizing the sum of the accuracy and the complexity.</li>
<li>Both methods are used to improve the generalization of decision tree by removing branches that do not contribute much to the classification or regression task.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pseudo-r-squaredpseudo-r2">Pseudo-R-squared/Pseudo-R2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pseudo-R-squared is a statistical measure that is used to assess the goodness of fit of a model, similar to the R-squared statistic used in traditional linear regression.</li>
<li>However, unlike R-squared, pseudo-R-squared is not a true measure of the proportion of variance explained by the model, and cannot be directly compared across different models or even different dependent variables.</li>
<li>Some examples of pseudo-R-squared are McFadden&rsquo;s R-squared, Cox and Snell R-squared, and Nagelkerke R-squared.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="r-squaredr2">R-squared/R2</h3>
<ul>
<li>R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the model to the data.</li>
<li>R-squared is a value between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the model to the data. An R-squared of 1 indicates that all variation in the dependent variable is completely explained by the independent variables, while an R-squared of 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variation in the dependent variable.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to remember that a high R-squared value doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the model is a good fit for the data, as it doesn&rsquo;t account for other important factors such as model complexity, outliers, or lack of independence of errors. Additionally, R-squared is not a model-independent measure, meaning that it is not comparable across different models or even different dependent variables.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="random-forest">Random forest</h3>
<ul>
<li>Random Forest is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression. It is a type of decision tree algorithm that creates multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to make a final decision.</li>
<li>The algorithm works by creating multiple decision trees, or &ldquo;forest,&rdquo; and each tree is created using a random subset of the data. These trees are then used to make predictions, and the final prediction is made by averaging or voting among the predictions of all the trees in the forest. This process is designed to reduce the overfitting that can occur when using a single decision tree by averaging out the errors made by individual trees.</li>
<li>Random Forest is considered to be one of the most accurate and robust machine learning algorithms available and it can handle both categorical and numerical features, as well as missing data. It is also relatively easy to interpret, and it can be used for feature selection, which is the process of identifying the most important features in the data.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s widely used in various industries and domains such as finance, healthcare, marketing, computer vision and natural language processing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="receiver-operating-characteristic-curve-roc-curve">Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve)</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classifier system as the discrimination threshold is varied. It is a plot of the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) for different threshold settings.</li>
<li>The ROC curve allows for the visualization of the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for every possible threshold setting. A good classifier will have a large area under the ROC curve (AUC), which means that it will have a good balance between the true positive rate and false positive rate. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect classifier, while an AUC of 0.5 represents a random classifier.</li>
<li>ROC curves are commonly used to evaluate the performance of diagnostic tests, but it can also be used for evaluating machine learning models. It&rsquo;s widely used in areas such as medicine, biometrics, natural language processing and computer vision.</li>
<li>It is important to note that ROC curves are used when the outcome variable is binary. In case of multi-class classification, one vs all ROC or micro and macro averaged ROC can be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="regression-1">Regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regression is a statistical method used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of regression is to find the best-fitting line or model that describes the relationship between the variables.</li>
<li>There are several types of regression, including linear regression, logistic regression, and polynomial regression.
<ul>
<li>Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The equation takes the form of Y = a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, a is the y-intercept, and b is the slope of the line.</li>
<li>Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is binary (i.e., it only takes on two possible values). It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category.</li>
<li>Polynomial regression is a generalization of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition to these basic types, there are many variations and extensions of regression, such as multiple regression, non-linear regression, and regularized regression.</li>
<li>Regression is widely used in various industries and domains such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="regression-splines">Regression splines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regression splines are a technique used to fit a smooth curve to a set of data points. They are a type of non-parametric regression method that can be used to model complex, non-linear relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.</li>
<li>A spline is a piecewise polynomial function that is used to approximate a smooth curve. The basic idea behind regression splines is to divide the independent variable into a set of intervals or knots and then fit a separate polynomial function to each interval. The polynomials are then &ldquo;stitched&rdquo; together to form a smooth curve that can be used to model the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.</li>
<li>There are several different types of regression splines, including natural cubic splines, thin plate splines, and radial basis function splines.</li>
<li>Regression splines are particularly useful when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is not well understood, or when the data points are non-linearly distributed. They are widely used in various fields such as economics, engineering, and bio-statistics.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that, unlike linear regression, the interpretability of the results in regression splines can be more challenging and require more expertise to understand the results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="regression-tree">Regression tree</h3>
<ul>
<li>A regression tree is a type of decision tree used for regression problems. It is a tree-based model where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents an outcome or predicted value.</li>
<li>The algorithm works by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the values of the input features. At each node, the algorithm selects the feature and the threshold that results in the most homogeneous subsets of the target variable. The process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a minimum number of samples per leaf or a maximum tree depth is reached.</li>
<li>Regression trees are simple to understand and interpret, they can handle both categorical and numerical features and missing values. They are also relatively insensitive to outliers, and they can handle non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables.</li>
<li>Regression trees are used for both linear and non-linear regression problems. They are widely used in various industries such as finance, healthcare, and engineering.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that, like other decision tree-based models, regression trees are prone to overfitting if the tree is grown too deep, therefore it&rsquo;s important to use techniques such as pruning to prevent overfitting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ridge-regression">Ridge regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that adds a L2 regularization term to the objective function. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the objective function that discourages large weights. The L2 regularization term is the sum of the squares of the weights.</li>
<li>The objective function in Ridge regression is defined as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>J(w) = 1/N * ∑(y - Xw)^2 + λ * ∑w^2
</code></pre><p>Where w is the weight vector, X is the input data, y is the target variable, N is the number of samples, and λ is the regularization term.</p>
<ul>
<li>The regularization term λ is a scalar that controls the strength of the regularization. A higher value of λ will result in smaller weights and a simpler model, while a lower value of λ will result in larger weights and a more complex model.</li>
<li>Ridge regression is particularly useful when there are a large number of correlated input features, as it tends to shrink the coefficients of correlated features towards each other.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that Ridge regression is similar to Lasso regression, which uses L1 regularization instead of L2 regularization. Lasso tends to produce sparse models, setting some of the weights to zero, while Ridge regression keeps all the weights non-zero but smaller.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="roc-curve">ROC curve</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classifier system as the discrimination threshold is varied. It is a plot of the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) for different threshold settings.</li>
<li>The ROC curve allows for the visualization of the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for every possible threshold setting. A good classifier will have a large area under the ROC curve (AUC), which means that it will have a good balance between the true positive rate and false positive rate. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect classifier, while an AUC of 0.5 represents a random classifier.</li>
<li>ROC curves are commonly used to evaluate the performance of diagnostic tests, but it can also be used for evaluating machine learning models. It&rsquo;s widely used in areas such as medicine, biometrics, natural language processing and computer vision.</li>
<li>It is important to note that ROC curves are used when the outcome variable is binary. In case of multi-class classification, one vs all ROC or micro and macro averaged ROC can be used.</li>
<li>Additionally, ROC curve is a powerful tool to evaluate the performance of a classifier, it&rsquo;s also important to consider other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, for a more comprehensive evaluation of the classifier performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="root">Root</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of regression, the &ldquo;root&rdquo; typically refers to the root node of a decision tree or a regression tree. A decision tree is a tree-based model where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents an outcome or predicted value.</li>
<li>In a regression tree, the root node represents the entire dataset, and the tree is built by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the values of the input features. At each internal node, the algorithm selects the feature and the threshold that results in the most homogeneous subsets of the target variable. The process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a minimum number of samples per leaf or a maximum tree depth is reached.</li>
<li>The root node of a regression tree represents the starting point of the tree, and the predictions are made by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node. The value at the leaf node is the predicted value for the given input.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that, like other decision tree-based models, regression trees are prone to overfitting if the tree is grown too deep, therefore it&rsquo;s important to use techniques such as pruning to prevent overfitting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spline-regression">Spline regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spline regression is a technique used to fit a smooth curve to a set of data points. It is a type of non-parametric regression method that can be used to model complex, non-linear relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.</li>
<li>A spline is a piecewise polynomial function that is used to approximate a smooth curve.

The polynomials are then &ldquo;stitched&rdquo; together to form a smooth curve that can be used to model the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.</li>
<li>There are several different types of spline regression, including natural cubic splines, thin plate splines, and radial basis function splines.</li>
<li>Spline regression is particularly useful when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is not well understood, or when the data points are non-linearly distributed. It&rsquo;s widely used in various fields such as economics, engineering, and bio-statistics.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that, unlike linear regression, the interpretability of the results in spline regression can be more challenging and require more expertise to understand the results. It&rsquo;s also important to select the appropriate number and location of knots to achieve a good balance between fit and smoothness.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transformation">Transformation</h3>
<ul>
<li>In regression, data transformation refers to the process of applying a mathematical function to a variable in order to change its distribution or relationship with other variables.</li>
<li>There are several reasons why data transformation may be necessary in regression:
<ul>
<li>Linearity: Linear regression assumes that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear. If the data violates this assumption, then transforming the variables can help to linearize the relationship.</li>
<li>Normality: Linear regression assumes that the errors are normally distributed. If the residuals are not normally distributed, then transforming the variables can help to improve the normality of the residuals.</li>
<li>Outliers: Outliers can have a large impact on the regression coefficients and can lead to poor predictions. Transforming the variables can help to reduce the influence of outliers.</li>
<li>Collinearity: Collinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated. Transforming the variables can help to reduce collinearity and improve the interpretability of the regression coefficients.
-Common transformations used in regression include:</li>
<li>Log transformation: It can be used to transform variables that have a positive skew, it can help to linearize the relationship between variables and reduce the influence of outliers.</li>
<li>Square root transformation: It can be used to transform variables that have a positive skew and is useful when the variable is strictly positive.</li>
<li>Box-Cox transformation: It is a more general transformation that can be used to handle a wide range of skewness, it can also be used to handle non-normality of the residuals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that, the choice of transformation depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. Additionally, the interpretation of the coefficients can be more challenging when using transformed variables.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tree">Tree</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Regression Tree is a type of decision tree used for regression problems. It is a tree-based model where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents an outcome or predicted value.</li>
<li>The algorithm works by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the values of the input features. At each node, the algorithm selects the feature and the threshold that results in the most homogeneous subsets of the target variable, using a criterion such as mean squared error, mean absolute error or others. The process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a minimum number of samples per leaf or a maximum tree depth is reached.</li>
<li>Regression trees are simple to understand and interpret, they can handle both categorical and numerical features and missing values. They can model non-linear relationships as well as interactions between features. They are also relatively insensitive to outliers, and they can handle non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables.</li>
<li>Regression trees are used for both linear and non-linear regression problems. They are widely used in various industries such as finance, healthcare, and engineering.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that, like other decision tree-based models, regression trees are prone to overfitting if the tree is grown too deep, therefore it&rsquo;s important to use techniques such as pruning or early stopping to prevent overfitting. Additionally, when dealing with large datasets, decision tree algorithms like random forest and gradient boosting can be used which tend to perform better than a single decision tree.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="time-series-models">Time series models</h2>
<h3 id="additive-seasonality">Additive seasonality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Additive seasonality refers to a pattern in which the seasonal component of a time series is modeled as a separate, additive component that is added to the overall trend. This means that the seasonal component is not considered to be related to the trend or the level of the time series, but is instead treated as an independent factor that affects the overall value of the time series.</li>
<li>In additive seasonality, the time series can be modeled as Y = T + S + E where Y is the original time series, T is the trend component, S is the seasonal component, and E is the error or residual component.</li>
<li>This type of seasonality is useful when the seasonal pattern is relatively constant over time and does not change with the level of the time series. It is often used in time series with a relatively small amplitude of seasonal fluctuations, such as temperature data.</li>
<li>Additive seasonality can be modeled using various methods such as moving averages, exponential smoothing, and seasonal decomposition of time series (STL), and it can be removed from the time series to better understand the underlying trend and forecast future values.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arima">ARIMA</h3>
<ul>
<li>ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a statistical model that is used to analyze and forecast time series data. It is a combination of three components: the autoregression (AR) component, the difference component (I for integrated), and the moving average (MA) component.
<ul>
<li>The autoregression (AR) component models the dependence between an observation and a number of lagged observations.</li>
<li>The difference component (I for integrated) models the dependence between an observation and the differences between consecutive observations (i.e., the dependence between an observation and the previous observation).</li>
<li>The moving average (MA) component models the dependence between the observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The parameters of the model, (p,d,q) are determined by analyzing the characteristics of the time series such as trend, seasonality and autocorrelation. The order of differencing (d) is used to make the time series stationary, this means that the mean and variance are constant over time.</li>
<li>ARIMA models are widely used in various industries such as finance, economics, and engineering to forecast future values of time series data. It&rsquo;s a powerful tool to model and forecast time series data, however, it can be challenging to determine the appropriate values for the parameters of the model, and the model assumptions must be met for accurate forecasting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="autoregression">Autoregression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Autoregression (AR) is a statistical model that describes the relationship between a variable and its own lagged values. It is a type of time series model that is used to analyze and forecast time series data.</li>
<li>In an autoregressive (AR) model, the current value of a variable is assumed to be a linear combination of its past values. Mathematically, an autoregressive model of order p is represented as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Yt = c + ϕ1Yt-1 + ϕ2Yt-2 + … + ϕpYt-p + εt
</code></pre><p>Where Yt is the value of the variable at time t, c is a constant, ϕ1, ϕ2, …, ϕp are the autoregressive coefficients, Yt-1, Yt-2, …, Yt-p are the lagged values of the variable, and εt is the error term.</p>
<ul>
<li>Autoregression is used to model the dependence between an observation and a number of lagged observations. It is widely used to model time series data that exhibit a predictable pattern such as a trend, seasonal pattern or cyclic behavior.</li>
<li>The order of the model (p) determines the number of lagged values that are used in the model. A higher order autoregression model will use more lagged values, which makes the model more complex but also more accurate.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that Autoregression is often used in combination with other models such as moving average and differencing to create a more complete time series model such as ARIMA or ARMA.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="differencing">Differencing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Differencing in time series refers to the process of taking the difference between consecutive observations in a time series data. It is used to remove the trend and/or seasonality in the data, and it is a common step in preparing time series data for analysis and forecasting.</li>
<li>There are two types of differencing: first difference and second difference.
<ul>
<li>First difference is calculated by subtracting the value of each observation from the value of the previous observation. This can be used to remove the trend in the data, making it stationary.</li>
<li>Second difference is calculated by taking the first difference and then subtracting the value of the first difference from the value of the previous first difference. This can be used to remove the seasonality in the data.
-Differencing can be used to remove both trend and seasonality in a time series by taking the first difference of the data to remove the trend, then taking the first difference of the difference data to remove the seasonality. This is known as seasonal differencing or second differencing, and it is represented as d=1, D=1 in the notation of ARIMA models, where d is the order of differencing and D is the seasonal order of differencing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that differencing can make the data more difficult to interpret, and it can also make it more challenging to forecast future values. Additionally, it is important to check the stationarity of the data before and after differencing to make sure that the differencing process has been done correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="double-exponential">Double exponential</h3>
<ul>
<li>Double Exponential Smoothing, also known as Holt-Winters method, is a technique used for forecasting time series data that takes into account both the level and trend of the data. It is an extension of exponential smoothing that adds a term for the trend component to the model.</li>
<li>In Double Exponential smoothing, the forecast for time t+1 is a weighted average of the level and the trend at time t, with weights determined by the smoothing parameters. The level component is similar to the simple exponential smoothing, while the trend component is a linear function of time.</li>
<li>The forecast equation can be represented as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>F(t+1) = αy(t) + (1-α)(F(t) + T(t))
</code></pre><p>Where F(t) is the forecast for time t, y(t) is the observed value at time t, T(t) is the trend at time t, and α is the smoothing parameter for the level component.</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Exponential Smoothing is suitable for time series that exhibit both a trend and seasonality. The method can be extended to include the seasonal component, called Holt-Winters seasonal method, by adding a term for the seasonal component to the model. It&rsquo;s widely used in various industries such as finance, economics, and engineering to forecast future values of time series data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="smoothing">smoothing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Smoothing refers to the process of making a set of data points less variable and more predictable. In time series analysis, smoothing is used to remove the noise or random variation in the data and to reveal the underlying trend or pattern.</li>
<li>There are several types of smoothing techniques used in time series analysis:
<ul>
<li>Moving average: This technique involves calculating the average value of a set of data points over a certain period of time (e.g., a rolling window of 3 or 7 days). This technique can be used to smooth out the noise in the data, but it can also smooth out the underlying pattern.</li>
<li>Exponential smoothing: This technique involves giving more weight to the more recent data points, and less weight to the older data points. This technique can be used to smooth out the noise in the data and to reveal the underlying trend.</li>
<li>Loess smoothing: This technique uses a local regression model that fits a polynomial function to the data points in a neighborhood around a target data point. It is a non-parametric method that can handle non-linear trends.</li>
<li>Savitzky-Golay filtering: This technique uses a polynomial least-squares method to smooth the data by fitting a polynomial to a set of data points. It can be used to smooth out noise and preserve the underlying pattern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Smoothing techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of predictions, but it&rsquo;s important to choose the appropriate smoothing technique depending on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. Additionally, over-smoothing can lead to loss of important information in the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exponential-smoothing">Exponential smoothing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exponential smoothing is a time series forecasting method that uses a weighted average of past observations to predict future values. It is used to smooth out the noise or random variation in the data and to reveal the underlying trend or pattern.</li>
<li>In exponential smoothing, the forecast for time t+1 is a weighted average of the past observations, with more weight given to the more recent observations. The weights decrease exponentially as the observations get older. The forecast equation can be represented as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>F(t+1) = α*y(t) + (1-α)*F(t)
</code></pre><p>Where F(t) is the forecast for time t, y(t) is the observed value at time t, and α is the smoothing parameter, a value between 0 and 1 that determines the weight given to the most recent observation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple Exponential smoothing is suitable for time series that do not have a trend or seasonality. However, Double Exponential Smoothing, also known as Holt-Winters method, is a more powerful technique that takes into account both the level and trend of the data and can be used for time series that exhibit both a trend and seasonality.</li>
<li>Exponential smoothing is a simple yet powerful method that can be used to forecast future values of time series data. It&rsquo;s widely used in various industries such as finance, economics, and engineering. It&rsquo;s important to note that the choice of the smoothing parameter α is important for the accuracy of the forecasts, and it can be chosen using methods such as grid search or optimization algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="generalized-autoregressive-conditional-heteroscedasticity-garch">Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)</h3>
<ul>
<li>GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) is a statistical model that is used to model and forecast volatility in financial time series data. It is an extension of the ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model, which was developed to model time series with varying variances, also known as volatility clustering.</li>
<li>The GARCH model is a combination of two components: the autoregressive component, which models the dependence between the current volatility and the past volatility, and the moving average component, which models the dependence between the current volatility and the past errors or residuals.</li>
<li>The GARCH model can be represented mathematically as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>σ^2(t) = ω + α* ε^2(t-1) + β*σ^2(t-1)
</code></pre><p>Where σ^2(t) is the conditional variance at time t, ε(t) is the error or residual at time t, ω is the constant term, α is the weight given to the past error, and β is the weight given to the past volatility.</p>
<ul>
<li>GARCH models are widely used in finance and economics to model and forecast volatility in financial time series data such as stock prices and exchange rates. It&rsquo;s an important tool for risk management, portfolio optimization and option pricing. GARCH models are typically estimated using maximum likelihood estimation and the order of the model (p,q) is determined by analyzing the characteristics of the time series such as autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="holt-winters-method">Holt-Winters method</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Holt-Winters method, also known as the triple exponential smoothing, is a technique used for forecasting time series data that takes into account both the level and trend of the data, as well as the seasonality of the data. It is an extension of the exponential smoothing method that adds a term for the trend component and a term for the seasonal component to the model.</li>
<li>The Holt-Winters method can be used to forecast future values in time series data that exhibit both a trend and a seasonality. It can be used in cases where the seasonal pattern is relatively stable over time, and the amplitude of the seasonal fluctuations is relatively constant.</li>
<li>The forecast equation can be represented as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>F(t+1) = αy(t) + (1-α)(F(t) + T(t)) + γ*(y(t) - y(t-m))
</code></pre><p>Where F(t) is the forecast for time t, y(t) is the observed value at time t, T(t) is the trend at time t, α is the smoothing parameter for the level component, γ is the smoothing parameter for the seasonal component, and m is the number of seasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Holt-Winters method can be used in various industries such as finance, economics, and engineering to forecast future values of time series data. It&rsquo;s important to note that the choice of the smoothing parameters α and γ is important for the accuracy of the forecasts, and it can be chosen using methods such as grid search or optimization algorithms. Additionally, when dealing with large datasets, advanced methods like ARIMA, ETS and SARIMA can be used which tend to perform better than Holt Winters method.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="moving-average">Moving average</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Moving Average (MA) is a statistical method used to smooth out fluctuations in time series data and to reveal the underlying trend. It is used to remove the noise or random variation in the data and to make the data more predictable.</li>
<li>In a moving average, a set of consecutive data points is used to calculate the average value, which is then used as a forecast for the next time period. The forecast for time t+1 is calculated by taking the average of a fixed number of past observations, called the window size. The moving average can be represented mathematically as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>F(t+1) = (1/n) * (y(t) + y(t-1) + … + y(t-n+1))
</code></pre><p>Where F(t+1) is the forecast for time t+1, y(t) is the observed value at time t, y(t-1) is the observed value at time t-1, and so on, n is the window size.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving average is a simple and widely used technique for time series analysis, it is computationally efficient, easy to understand and interpret. However, it can be sensitive to outliers and it can also smooth out the underlying pattern, especially if the window size is too large.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to choose the appropriate window size for the moving average depending on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. Additionally, it is important to check the stationarity of the data before and after the moving average is applied to make sure that the process has been done correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multiplicative-seasonality">Multiplicative seasonality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multiplicative seasonality refers to a pattern in which the seasonal component of a time series is modeled as a separate, multiplicative component that is multiplied by the overall trend. This means that the seasonal component is considered to be related to the trend or the level of the time series, and it affects the overall value of the time series in proportion to the level.</li>
<li>In multiplicative seasonality, the time series can be modeled as Y = T * S * E where Y is the original time series, T is the trend component, S is the seasonal component, and E is the error or residual component. This type of seasonality is useful when the seasonal pattern changes with the level of the time series, such as sales data or temperature data.</li>
<li>Multiplicative seasonality can be modeled using various methods such as moving averages, exponential smoothing, and seasonal decomposition of time series (STL), and it can be removed from the time series to better understand the underlying trend and forecast future values. It&rsquo;s important to note that when working with data that has multiplicative seasonality, it is necessary to log transform the data in order to make it additive, this way it&rsquo;s easier to forecast with traditional methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="seasonalitycycles">Seasonality/cycles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Seasonality refers to patterns in time series data that occur at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, or yearly. These patterns are often predictable and can be used to forecast future values. Seasonality can be caused by natural or man-made factors such as weather, holidays, or business cycles.</li>
<li>Cycles refer to patterns in time series data that occur at irregular intervals, but are still predictable. These patterns can be caused by economic or political factors, and they can be used to forecast future values.</li>
<li>Both seasonality and cycles can have an impact on the forecast of a time series. Identifying and modeling seasonality and cycles can improve the accuracy of forecasts by taking into account these predictable patterns.</li>
<li>There are several methods used to identify and model seasonality and cycles in time series data, such as:</li>
<li>Visual inspection of the time series plot,</li>
<li>Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots,</li>
<li>Seasonal decomposition of time series (STL),</li>
<li>Spectral analysis, and others.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that for some time series, the patterns could be complex, and a combination of methods may be necessary to fully capture the seasonality and cycles. Additionally, once identified, those patterns can be removed from the time series to better understand the underlying trend and forecast future values.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="seasonality-lengthcycle-length">Seasonality length/cycle length</h3>
<ul>
<li>Seasonality length refers to the number of time periods in a seasonal pattern. For example, in a daily time series, a seasonality length of 7 would indicate a weekly pattern, while a seasonality length of 365 would indicate a yearly pattern. The length of the seasonality can be determined by analyzing the time series data, and it is an important factor when choosing an appropriate model for the data.</li>
<li>Cycle length refers to the number of time periods in a cyclical pattern. It is similar to seasonality length, but it is used to describe patterns that occur at irregular intervals. The length of a cycle can vary depending on the nature of the data and the underlying causes of the pattern.</li>
<li>When working with time series data, it&rsquo;s important to determine the correct seasonality length and cycle length, as it will help in choosing the appropriate model for the data and in forecasting future values.</li>
<li>The length of seasonality can be determined by visual inspection of the time series plot, by analyzing autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots, or by using decomposition methods such as seasonal decomposition of time series (STL). For cycles, spectral analysis or other advanced methods can be used to identify the length of the cycle.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that the length of seasonality and cycle can change over time, and it&rsquo;s important to monitor and update the model if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="single-exponential-smoothing">Single exponential smoothing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) is a time series forecasting method that uses a weighted average of past observations to predict future values. It is used to smooth out the noise or random variation in the data and to reveal the underlying trend or pattern.</li>
<li>In single exponential smoothing, the forecast for time t+1 is a weighted average of the past observations, with more weight given to the most recent observation. The weights decrease exponentially as the observations get older. The forecast equation can be represented as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>F(t+1) = α*y(t) + (1-α)*F(t)
</code></pre><p>Where F(t) is the forecast for time t, y(t) is the observed value at time t, and α is the smoothing parameter, a value between 0 and 1 that determines the weight given to the most recent observation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Exponential Smoothing is suitable for time series that do not have a trend or seasonality. It is a simple and easy to understand method that can be used to forecast future values of time series data, it&rsquo;s widely used in various industries such as finance, economics, and engineering. However, it may not be the best method to be used when the data has a trend or seasonality.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that the choice of the smoothing parameter α is important for the accuracy of the forecasts, and it can be chosen using methods such as grid search or optimization algorithms. It&rsquo;s also important to check the stationarity of the data before and after the single exponential smoothing is applied to make sure that the process has been done correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="smoothing-1">Smoothing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Smoothing refers to the process of making a set of data points less variable and more predictable. In time series analysis, smoothing is used to remove the noise or random variation in the data and to reveal the underlying trend or pattern.</li>
<li>There are several types of smoothing techniques used in time series analysis:
<ul>
<li>Moving average: This technique involves calculating the average value of a set of data points over a certain period of time (e.g., a rolling window of 3 or 7 days). This technique can be used to smooth out the noise in the data, but it can also smooth out the underlying pattern.</li>
<li>Exponential smoothing: This technique involves giving more weight to the more recent data points, and less weight to the older data points. This technique can be used to smooth out the noise in the data and to reveal the underlying trend.</li>
<li>Loess smoothing: This technique uses a local regression model that fits a polynomial function to the data points in a neighborhood around a target data point. It is a non-parametric method that can handle non-linear trends.</li>
<li>Savitzky-Golay filtering: This technique uses a polynomial least-squares method to smooth the data by fitting a polynomial to a set of data points. It can be used to smooth out noise and preserve the underlying pattern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Smoothing techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of predictions, but it&rsquo;s important to choose the appropriate smoothing technique depending on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. Additionally, over-smoothing can lead to loss of important information in the data.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s worth noting that some of these methods are more suited for certain types of data and it&rsquo;s important to select the right one to achieve the best results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="smoothing-constant">Smoothing constant</h3>
<ul>
<li>A smoothing constant is a parameter used in smoothing techniques, such as exponential smoothing, that determines the weight given to the most recent observations. It is used to control the amount of smoothing applied to the data.</li>
<li>In exponential smoothing, the smoothing constant (also known as the smoothing parameter) is denoted by α and it is a value between 0 and 1. A value of α close to 1 gives more weight to the most recent observations and less weight to the older observations, which results in less smoothing. A value of α close to 0 gives more weight to the older observations and less weight to the most recent observations, which results in more smoothing.</li>
<li>The choice of the smoothing constant is important for the accuracy of the forecasts. A high value of α will give more weight to recent observations, which is useful when the data is highly variable and the underlying trend is changing rapidly. A low value of α will give more weight to older observations, which is useful when the data is less variable and the underlying trend is relatively stable.</li>
<li>The smoothing constant can be chosen using methods such as grid search or optimization algorithms, where different values of α are tried and the one that results in the best forecast accuracy is selected.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also important to note that the smoothing constant is different for each type of smoothing technique, for example, in moving average, it&rsquo;s the window size that acts as a smoothing constant.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stationary-process">Stationary process</h3>
<ul>
<li>A stationary process is a time series in which the statistical properties (such as mean, variance, and autocovariance) are constant over time. In other words, a stationary time series has a constant mean, a constant variance, and a constant autocovariance that does not change over time.</li>
<li>A process is said to be stationary if the following conditions are met:
<ul>
<li>The mean is constant over time</li>
<li>The variance is constant over time</li>
<li>The covariance between observations at different times is constant over time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A stationary process is useful for time series forecasting because the future behavior of a stationary process can be predicted using its past behavior. For example, if a time series has a constant mean and a constant variance, then it is possible to predict the future values of the series using the past values.</li>
<li>There are two types of stationary process:
<ul>
<li>Weakly stationary: The mean, variance, and autocovariance function do not depend on time.</li>
<li>Strictly stationary: The joint probability distribution of any two or more random variables is the same for all time pairs or groups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stationarity is an important assumption in many time series models such as ARIMA and GARCH. To check if a time series is stationary, one can use visual inspection of the time series plot, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test. Additionally, when the data is not stationary, it can be made stationary using techniques such as differencing, logarithmic transformation and detrending.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trend">Trend</h3>
<ul>
<li>A trend refers to a pattern in time series data that shows a gradual increase or decrease in the value of the data over time. Trends can be upward, downward, or flat. An upward trend indicates that the value of the data is increasing over time, a downward trend indicates that the value of the data is decreasing over time, and a flat trend indicates that the value of the data is staying relatively constant over time.</li>
<li>Trends can be caused by various factors such as economic growth, population growth, technological advancements, and more. Identifying and modeling trends in time series data can improve the accuracy of forecasts by taking into account the long-term patterns in the data.</li>
<li>There are several methods used to identify and model trends in time series data, such as:
<ul>
<li>Visual inspection of the time series plot</li>
<li>Linear regression</li>
<li>Exponential smoothing</li>
<li>Trend decomposition and others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that trends can change over time, and it&rsquo;s important to monitor and update the model if necessary. Additionally, it&rsquo;s important to identify the right type of trend, linear or non-linear, as this will help in choosing the appropriate model for the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="triple-exponential-smoothing">Triple exponential smoothing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Triple Exponential Smoothing, also known as the Holt-Winters method, is a time series forecasting method that uses a weighted average of past observations, past trends, and past seasonal patterns to predict future values. It is used to smooth out the noise or random variation in the data and to reveal the underlying trend, pattern, and seasonality of the data.</li>
<li>In triple exponential smoothing, the forecast for time t+1 is a weighted average of the past observations, past trends, and past seasonal patterns, with more weight given to the more recent observations, trends, and seasonal patterns. The weights decrease exponentially as the observations, trends, and seasonal patterns get older.</li>
<li>The forecast equation can be represented as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>F(t+1) = αy(t) + (1-α)(F(t) + T(t)) + γ*(y(t) - y(t-m))
</code></pre><p>Where F(t) is the forecast for time t, y(t) is the observed value at time t, T(t) is the trend at time t, α is the smoothing parameter for the level component, γ is the smoothing parameter for the seasonal component, and m is the number of seasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Triple Exponential Smoothing is suitable for time series that have trend and seasonality. It is a more advanced and sophisticated method than single and double exponential smoothing. It can be used in various industries such as finance, economics, and engineering to forecast future values of time series data.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that the choice of the smoothing parameters α and γ is important for the accuracy of the forecasts, and it can be chosen using methods such as grid search or optimization algorithms. Additionally, it&rsquo;s important to check the stationarity of the data before and after the triple exponential smoothing is applied to make sure that the process has been done correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="winters-method">Winters&rsquo; method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Winters&rsquo; method, also known as Exponential smoothing with additive damped trend and additive seasonality, is a forecasting method for time series data that includes trends and seasonality.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a variation of the Holt-Winters method, which is a generalization of exponential smoothing method that adds a trend and a seasonality component to the forecast equation.</li>
<li>The Winters&rsquo; method uses two smoothing parameters, α and β, to control the level and trend components, respectively, and another parameter, γ, to control the seasonal component. The method is designed to forecast future values based on the past observations, past trends and past seasonal patterns.</li>
<li>The forecast equation for Winters&rsquo; method can be represented as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>F(t+h|t) = l_t + h*b_t + s_{t-m+1+h(mod m)}
</code></pre><p>Where F(t+h|t) is the forecast for time t+h, l_t is the level at time t, b_t is the trend at time t, s_i is the seasonal component at time i, h is the forecast horizon, m is the number of seasons, and the mod operator denotes the modulo operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Winters&rsquo; method can be used to forecast future values of time series data with additive seasonality and trends and it&rsquo;s suitable for data that has a stable pattern. It&rsquo;s widely used in various industries such as finance, economics, and engineering, just like Holt-Winters method.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that the choice of the smoothing parameters α, β and γ is important for the accuracy of the forecasts, and it can be chosen using methods such as grid search or optimization algorithms. Additionally, it&rsquo;s important to check the stationarity of the data before and after the Winters&rsquo; method is applied to make sure that the process has been done correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variable-selection">Variable Selection</h2>
<h3 id="backward-elimination">Backward elimination</h3>
<ul>
<li>Backward elimination is a feature selection method used in regression analysis to identify the most important predictor variables that contribute to the response variable. The method starts with all the predictor variables in the model and then iteratively removes the variable that has the least statistical significance until all remaining variables are considered important.</li>
<li>The basic steps of backward elimination are:
<ul>
<li>Start with a full model that includes all predictor variables.</li>
<li>Fit the model and calculate the p-value for each predictor variable.</li>
<li>Select the predictor variable with the highest p-value and remove it from the model.</li>
<li>Fit the model again with the remaining variables and calculate the p-value for each variable.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all remaining variables have p-values lower than a given threshold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The threshold for the p-value is usually set to 0.05, which means that a predictor variable will be removed from the model if its p-value is greater than 0.05. This threshold can be adjusted depending on the specific application and the desired level of significance.</li>
<li>Backward elimination is a simple and easy to understand method, and it&rsquo;s widely used in various industries such as finance, economics, and engineering. However, it has some limitations, such as it can be computationally expensive and it could lead to overfitting if the number of observations is not large enough.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that Backward elimination should be used in combination with other feature selection methods, such as forward selection and recursive feature elimination, to get a more robust model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elastic-net-1">Elastic net</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elastic net is a regularization method used in linear regression to prevent overfitting by combining the L1 regularization (also known as Lasso) and L2 regularization (also known as Ridge) techniques. The L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, and the L2 regularization adds a penalty term that is proportional to the square of the coefficients.</li>
<li>The elastic net method is controlled by two parameters: α, the mixing parameter that controls the balance between L1 and L2 regularization, and λ, the regularization parameter that controls the overall strength of the regularization.</li>
<li>When α = 0, the elastic net is equivalent to the Ridge regularization. When α = 1, the elastic net is equivalent to the Lasso regularization. For 0 &lt; α &lt; 1, the elastic net is a combination of Ridge and Lasso and it can select some variables while shrinking others.</li>
<li>The elastic net method can be used to handle collinearity and when the number of predictors is greater than the number of observations. It also can handle correlated features and can be used to select relevant features.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that the selection of the α and λ parameters is important for the performance of the elastic net method. It&rsquo;s usually done using cross-validation or other optimization techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="forward-selection">Forward selection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Forward selection is a feature selection method used in regression analysis to identify the most important predictor variables that contribute to the response variable. The method starts with an empty model and then iteratively adds the variable that has the highest statistical significance until all remaining variables are considered important.</li>
<li>The basic steps of forward selection are:
<ul>
<li>Start with an empty model that includes no predictor variables.</li>
<li>Fit the model and calculate the p-value for each predictor variable.</li>
<li>Select the predictor variable with the lowest p-value and add it to the model.</li>
<li>Fit the model again with the added variable and calculate the p-value for each variable.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all remaining variables have p-values lower than a given threshold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The threshold for the p-value is usually set to 0.05, which means that a predictor variable will be added to the model if its p-value is lower than 0.05. This threshold can be adjusted depending on the specific application and the desired level of significance.</li>
<li>Forward selection is a simple and easy to understand method, and it&rsquo;s widely used in various industries such as finance, economics, and engineering. However, it has some limitations, such as it can be computationally expensive and it could lead to overfitting if the number of observations is not large enough.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that Forward selection should be used in combination with other feature selection methods, such as backward elimination and recursive feature elimination, to get a more robust model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lassolasso-regression">Lasso/Lasso regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lasso regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a linear regression method that uses L1 regularization to shrink the coefficients of the predictor variables towards zero. L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. The L1 penalty term causes some coefficients to be exactly equal to zero, which results in some predictor variables being completely excluded from the model.</li>
<li>The Lasso method solves the following optimization problem:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>minimize (1/n) * ||y - Xw||^2 + λ * ||w||_1
</code></pre><p>Where w is the vector of coefficients, X is the design matrix, y is the response variable, λ is the regularization parameter, and ||w||_1 is the L1-norm of the coefficients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lasso regression can be used to handle high-dimensional data with many predictor variables, where some of the variables may be irrelevant. It can also be used to handle correlated features and can be used to select relevant features.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that the choice of the regularization parameter λ is important for the performance of the Lasso regression, as it controls the trade-off between the goodness of fit and the complexity of the model. It&rsquo;s usually done using cross-validation or other optimization techniques, and it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that Lasso will always produce sparse models, i.e. models with few non-zero coefficients.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overfitting">Overfitting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overfitting is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model is trained to fit the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. It occurs when a model is too complex or has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available.</li>
<li>Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning and can be caused by various factors, such as:
<ul>
<li>Having too many features or variables relative to the number of observations</li>
<li>Using a complex model with a large number of parameters</li>
<li>Using a model that is not well-suited for the data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a model is overfitting, it will perform well on the training data but poorly on the testing data. This is because the model has learned the noise in the training data and not the underlying pattern. The model becomes too specialized to the training data, rather than generalizing to new, unseen data.</li>
<li>To prevent overfitting, several techniques can be used, such as:
<ul>
<li>Simplifying the model by reducing the number of features or parameters</li>
<li>Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization</li>
<li>Early stopping</li>
<li>Using cross-validation to estimate the generalization error</li>
<li>Ensemble methods such as random forests and gradient boosting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that a balance between underfitting and overfitting should be sought, and the best model is the one that generalizes well on unseen data while keeping the complexity at bay.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="regularization">Regularization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and statistics to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function of the model. The purpose of regularization is to shrink the coefficients of the predictor variables towards zero, which reduces the complexity of the model and the variance of the predictions.</li>
<li>There are two main types of regularization: L1 and L2 regularization.</li>
<li>L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This type of regularization tends to shrink the coefficients of the less important features to zero, effectively removing them from the model.</li>
<li>L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the square of the coefficients. This type of regularization tends to shrink the coefficients of all features, but it doesn&rsquo;t remove any features from the model.</li>
<li>The regularization term is controlled by a regularization parameter, which determines the strength of the regularization. A smaller regularization parameter results in stronger regularization and a larger parameter results in weaker regularization. The regularization parameter can be chosen using cross-validation or other optimization techniques.</li>
<li>Regularization is used to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model, it&rsquo;s used in various types of models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. Regularization can be used alone or in combination with other techniques such as early stopping, dropout, and data augmentation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ridge-regression-1">Ridge regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ridge regression is a linear regression method that uses L2 regularization to shrink the coefficients of the predictor variables towards zero. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the square of the coefficients. The L2 penalty term causes the coefficients to be close to zero, but not exactly zero, which results in a model that is less complex than the unregularized model.</li>
<li>The Ridge method solves the following optimization problem:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>minimize (1/n) * ||y - Xw||^2 + λ * ||w||^2_2
</code></pre><p>Where w is the vector of coefficients, X is the design matrix, y is the response variable, λ is the regularization parameter, and ||w||^2_2 is the L2-norm of the coefficients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ridge regression can be used to handle high-dimensional data with many predictor variables, where some of the variables may be irrelevant. It can also be used to handle correlated features and can handle multicollinearity.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that Ridge regression shrinks the coefficient towards zero, but it doesn&rsquo;t eliminate any feature from the model. Also, the choice of the regularization parameter λ is important for the performance of the Ridge regression, as it controls the trade-off between the goodness of fit and the complexity of the model. It&rsquo;s usually done using cross-validation or other optimization techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simplicity-of-a-model">Simplicity (of a model)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity of a model refers to how easy it is to understand and interpret the model, and how few parameters it has relative to the amount of data available. A simple model has a small number of parameters and is easy to understand, while a complex model has a large number of parameters and is difficult to understand.</li>
<li>Simplicity of a model is important because it helps to reduce overfitting, as a simple model is less likely to fit the noise in the data. Simple models are also easier to interpret and explain, which is important in many real-world applications.</li>
<li>However, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that a model that is too simple might not capture the underlying patterns in the data and might underfit the data, leading to poor predictions. Therefore, a balance between simplicity and complexity should be sought in building a model.</li>
<li>There are several techniques that can be used to make a model simpler, such as:
<ul>
<li>Feature selection: removing irrelevant or redundant features from the data</li>
<li>Dimensionality reduction: reducing the number of features in the data</li>
<li>Regularization: adding a penalty term to the cost function to shrink the coefficients of the model</li>
<li>Ensemble methods: combining multiple simpler models to make a more robust model</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that the choice of a model depends on the specific problem and the data available, so it&rsquo;s important to evaluate different models and select the one that strikes the right balance between simplicity and complexity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stepwise-regression">Stepwise regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stepwise regression is a feature selection method used in regression analysis to identify the most important predictor variables that contribute to the response variable. It is a type of automated feature selection method that combines both forward selection and backward elimination by iteratively adding or removing variables based on their statistical significance.</li>
<li>The basic steps of stepwise regression are:
<ul>
<li>Start with an empty model or a full model that includes all predictor variables</li>
<li>Fit the model and calculate the p-value for each predictor variable.</li>
<li>Select the predictor variable with the lowest p-value (forward selection) or the highest p-value (backward elimination) and add or remove it from the model.</li>
<li>Fit the model again with the updated variables and calculate the p-value for each variable.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until no more variables can be added or removed from the model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stepwise regression is a simple and easy to understand method, and it&rsquo;s widely used in various industries such as finance, economics, and engineering. However, it has some limitations, such as it can be computationally expensive and it could lead to overfitting if the number of observations is not large enough. Additionally, it&rsquo;s a greedy method and it may not find the optimal solution.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that Stepwise regression should be used with caution, it&rsquo;s not recommended to rely solely on this method, and it&rsquo;s important to use it in combination with other feature selection methods, such as forward selection, backward elimination, and recursive feature elimination, to get a more robust model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="variable-selection-1">Variable selection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Variable selection is the process of identifying a subset of relevant variables from a larger set of predictor variables for a given problem. It&rsquo;s an important step in building a machine learning model as it can help to improve the model&rsquo;s performance, reduce overfitting, and make the model more interpretable.</li>
<li>There are several variable selection methods that can be used, such as:
<ul>
<li>Filter methods: These methods use a pre-defined criterion, such as correlation or mutual information, to select a subset of variables. They are generally fast, but they may not select the best subset of variables for the problem.</li>
<li>Wrapper methods: These methods use the performance of a given model to select a subset of variables. They are more computationally expensive than filter methods, but they generally select a better subset of variables for the problem.</li>
<li>Embedded methods: These methods use the optimization of the model&rsquo;s parameters as part of the variable selection process. Examples include Lasso and Ridge regression.</li>
<li>Hybrid methods: These methods combine the strengths of different variable selection methods to select the best subset of variables for the problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that the choice of a variable selection method depends on the specific problem and the data available, and it&rsquo;s important to evaluate different methods and select the one that strikes the right balance between model&rsquo;s performance and interpretability. Additionally, it&rsquo;s important to use variable selection in conjunction with other techniques such as regularization, feature engineering, and model evaluation to get a more robust model.</li>

<li>The 1-norm, also known as the L1-norm, is a measure of the size or magnitude of a vector, and it&rsquo;s calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the vector&rsquo;s elements. It&rsquo;s also called the &ldquo;Manhattan norm&rdquo; or &ldquo;taxi-cab norm&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s the distance between two points in a grid if you can only move horizontally or vertically, like a taxi driving on the streets of Manhattan.</li>
<li>The L1-norm of a vector x is defined as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>||x||1 = ∑|x_i|
</code></pre><p>Where x_i is the i-th element of the vector x.</p>
<ul>
<li>The L1-norm has several properties, such as:
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not differentiable at x_i = 0</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not a Euclidean norm, meaning that it doesn&rsquo;t satisfy the triangle inequality</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not a norm in the mathematical sense, since it doesn&rsquo;t satisfy the homogeneity and subadditivity properties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The L1-norm is used in various areas of machine learning and optimization, such as in Lasso regression, and in feature selection, where it&rsquo;s used as a measure of feature importance. In Lasso regression, the L1-norm is used as a regularization term to shrink the coefficients of the predictor variables towards zero. This results in some variables being completely excluded from the model, effectively performing feature selection.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also used in the field of computer vision, particularly in problems such as image denoising, where the L1-norm is used to minimize the difference between the original image and the denoised image.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-norm">2-norm</h3>
<ul>
<li>The 2-norm, also known as the L2-norm or Euclidean norm, is a measure of the size or magnitude of a vector, and it&rsquo;s calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the vector&rsquo;s elements. It&rsquo;s the most commonly used norm in machine learning and optimization, and it&rsquo;s the standard Euclidean distance between two points in a space.</li>
<li>The L2-norm of a vector x is defined as:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>||x||2 = √( ∑x_i^2 )

<li>It&rsquo;s a norm in the mathematical sense, since it satisfies the homogeneity and subadditivity properties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The L2-norm is used in various areas of machine learning and optimization, such as in Ridge regression, and in feature selection, where it&rsquo;s used as a measure of feature importance.

This results in a model that is less complex than the unregularized model.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also used in various other areas such as in control theory, where it&rsquo;s used to measure the stability of a system, and in image processing, where it&rsquo;s used to measure the quality of image reconstructions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="convex-hull-of-a-set-of-points">Convex hull (of a set of points)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points in the set. A convex polygon is a shape where, for any two points inside the shape, the entire line segment between them is also contained within the shape. In other words, all interior angles are less than 180 degrees.</li>
<li>There are different algorithms to compute the convex hull of a set of points, such as:
<ul>
<li>Graham’s scan algorithm</li>
<li>Jarvis march (or gift wrapping) algorithm</li>
<li>QuickHull algorithm</li>
<li>Chan&rsquo;s algorithm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The convex hull is a fundamental concept in computational geometry and it&rsquo;s used in various areas such as computer graphics, image processing, and pattern recognition. It can be used, for example, to find the boundaries of a shape, to compute the area of a shape, or to find the shortest path between two points that lies within a shape.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also used in machine learning and data analysis, such as in clustering, where it&rsquo;s used to define the boundaries of clusters and in outlier detection, where it&rsquo;s used to define the boundaries of the data set.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that, a set of points that are all collinear, the Convex Hull will be a line segment, and in the case where there are only two points in the set, the Convex Hull will be the two points themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="descriptive-analytics">Descriptive analytics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Descriptive analytics is a branch of data analytics that is used to summarize, describe, and understand data. It involves the use of various techniques such as statistics, data visualization, and data mining to extract insights and information from data. The goal of descriptive analytics is to understand the characteristics of the data, such as patterns, trends, and relationships, and to communicate those insights effectively to stakeholders.</li>
<li>Descriptive analytics can be applied to various types of data, such as transactional data, log data, sensor data, and social media data. It can be used to answer questions such as:
<ul>
<li>What are the most common patterns in the data?</li>
<li>What are the key trends in the data?</li>
<li>How is the data distributed?</li>
<li>Are there any outliers or anomalies in the data?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some of the common techniques used in descriptive analytics include:
<ul>
<li>Summarizing data using measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, variance, range)</li>
<li>Creating data visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to help understand the data</li>
<li>Identifying patterns and relationships in the data using techniques such as correlation analysis, cluster analysis, and association rule mining</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Descriptive analytics is a fundamental step in the data analytics process and it&rsquo;s essential to understand the data before performing more advanced analytics such as predictive or prescriptive analytics. It&rsquo;s used in various industries such as finance, retail, healthcare, and manufacturing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elbow-diagram">Elbow diagram</h3>
<ul>
<li>An elbow diagram is a graphical representation of the performance of a clustering algorithm, typically used to determine the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset. The elbow method is a heuristic used to determine this optimal number of clusters.</li>
<li>The process of creating an elbow diagram involves running the clustering algorithm multiple times with different values of the number of clusters (k) and calculating the sum of squared distances between each point and its nearest centroid (also called Within-cluster-sum-of-squares or WCSS).</li>
<li>The elbow diagram is a plot of the WCSS against the number of clusters (k) and the idea is that, as the number of clusters increases, the WCSS will decrease. However, as the number of clusters increases, the decrease in WCSS will become less pronounced. The point at which the decrease in WCSS begins to level off is considered to be the optimal number of clusters, and it&rsquo;s typically represented by an &ldquo;elbow&rdquo; shape on the plot.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that the elbow method is a heuristic and it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee to find the optimal number of clusters, and it&rsquo;s not suitable for all types of data.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s recommended to use it in combination with other techniques such as the silhouette method and the gap statistic to get a better understanding of the data and make a more informed decision about the optimal number of clusters.</li>

In other words, the Euclidean distance between two points, P and Q, in n-dimensional space is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences of their coordinates.</li>
<li>It is also known as L2 norm or L2 distance. It is widely used in various applications such as image processing, clustering, and pattern recognition.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heteroscedasticity">Heteroscedasticity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heteroscedasticity is a statistical term used to describe a situation in which the variance of a variable is non-constant across the range of values of a predictor variable. In other words, it refers to a situation in which the spread of the dependent variable is not the same across all levels of the independent variable. Heteroscedasticity can occur in linear regression models and can lead to unreliable parameter estimates and inaccurate hypothesis tests.</li>
<li>It can be detected by visual inspection of a residual plot or by formal tests such as the Breusch-Pagan test or the White test. To address heteroscedasticity, one can use techniques such as weighted least squares, or use of heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors.</li>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>||x||∞ = max(|x1|,|x2|, …, |xn|)
</code></pre><ul>
<li>This norm is particularly useful when dealing with large or infinite dimensional vectors, such as sequences or functions, as it provides a way to measure the &ldquo;size&rdquo; or &ldquo;magnitude&rdquo; of a vector. It is also known as Chebyshev norm or L∞ norm.</li>
<li>It is widely used in various fields such as optimization, control theory and numerical analysis.</li>

<ul>
<li>A linear combination is an expression of the form c1x1 + c2x2 + … + cnxn, where x1, x2, …, xn are variables and c1, c2, …, cn are constants. It is a linear combination of variables, because the exponents of the variables are 1 and the coefficients are constants.</li>
<li>Linear combinations are used in many areas of mathematics and science, such as linear algebra, physics, and economics. They are also used to express a vector as a linear combination of other vectors, known as a basis. Linear combinations are used to express a solution of a linear system of equations in terms of the coefficients of the variables.</li>
<li>In linear algebra, a linear combination of a set of vectors is a vector that can be obtained by multiplying each vector by a scalar (a constant) and then adding the results.</li>
<li>In summary, a linear combination is a mathematical expression that is composed of variables multiplied by scalars, and added together.</li>

</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>||P - Q||1 = |p1 - q1| + |p2 - q2| + … + |pn - qn|
</code></pre><ul>
<li>The Manhattan distance is named after the grid layout of the streets in Manhattan, where one can only travel on the grid horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. It is less affected by outliers than the Euclidean distance and thus often used in clustering and image processing.</li>
<li>It is also used in other fields such as natural language processing, recommendation systems and in machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minkowski-distance-of-order-𝑝">Minkowski distance (of order 𝑝)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minkowski distance is a generalization of both the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance. It is a measure of the distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space, and it is defined as the pth root of the sum of the absolute differences in their coordinates, raised to the power of p.</li>
<li>Given two points P = (p1, p2, …, pn) and Q = (q1, q2, …, qn) in an n-dimensional space, the Minkowski distance between them is:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>||P - Q||p = (|p1 - q1|^p + |p2 - q2|^p + … + |pn - qn|^p)^(1/p)

Depending on the complexity and accuracy of the model, it can be used for different purposes such as forecasting, prediction, optimization, control, or understanding.</li>
<li>There are many types of models, such as:
<ul>
<li>Deterministic models: the output of the model is completely determined by the initial conditions and the model&rsquo;s parameters.</li>
<li>Stochastic models: the output of the model is determined by both the initial conditions and a random variable.
Static models: the model represents a snapshot of the system at a certain point in time.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="multiplier">Multiplier</h3>
<ul>
<li>In mathematics, a multiplier is a scalar or a vector that is used to scale or change the magnitude of another vector or a scalar.</li>
<li>In a linear equation, a multiplier is a coefficient that is multiplied by a variable to increase or decrease its value. In other words, it is a factor by which a value is multiplied. For example, in the equation y = 2x, 2 is the multiplier of x.</li>
<li>In vector algebra, a multiplier is a scalar that is used to scale a vector. For example, multiplying a vector by 2 will double its magnitude. Similarly, multiplying a vector by -1 will change its direction.</li>

<h3 id="normdistance-norm">Norm/distance norm</h3>
<ul>
<li>In mathematics, a norm, also known as a distance norm, is a function that assigns a non-negative value to each vector in a vector space, with the following properties:</li>

<li>The concept of order of magnitude is used to simplify and approximate large or small numbers by reducing them to a single digit followed by a power of 10. This can be useful when comparing numbers that are vastly different in size, or when working with scientific or engineering data.</li>
<li>Order of magnitude can also be used to estimate the relative uncertainty of a measurement. For example, a measurement that is accurate to within one order of magnitude is considered to be roughly accurate, while a measurement that is accurate to within three orders of magnitude is considered to be less precise.</li>
<li>In summary, the order of magnitude of a number is a measure of the size of the number relative to some reference value and it is typically represented as a power of 10. It is a way of simplifying and approximating large or small numbers, and it is also used to estimate the relative uncertainty of a measurement.</li>

<h3 id="orthogonal">Orthogonal</h3>
<ul>
<li>In mathematics, orthogonality refers to the concept of two or more objects being perpendicular to each other. The objects in question can be vectors, matrices, subspaces, functions and more.
<ul>
<li>Orthogonal vectors: Two vectors are said to be orthogonal if the angle between them is 90 degrees. This means that the dot product of the vectors is equal to 0.
Orthonormal vectors: Two vectors are said to be orthonormal if they are orthogonal and have a norm of 1. This means that they are not only perpendicular to each other, but also have a unit length.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="outlier">Outlier</h3>
<ul>
<li>In statistics and data analysis, an outlier is an observation that is significantly different from the other observations in a dataset. It can be caused by measurement error, data entry errors, or by the presence of rare and unusual events. Outliers can have a significant impact on the results of statistical analyses, and can lead to misleading conclusions if they are not identified and dealt with appropriately.
<ul>
<li>There are several ways to identify outliers, including:</li>
<li>Visual inspection of data, such as scatter plots and box plots</li>
<li>Using descriptive statistics, such as the mean and standard deviation, to identify observations that are significantly different from the majority of the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Once outliers have been identified, there are several ways to deal with them, including:
<ul>
<li>Removing them from the dataset, if they are believed to be caused by measurement error or data entry errors.</li>
<li>Keeping them in the dataset, but treating them as special cases in the analysis, if they are believed to be caused by rare and unusual events that are important to the research.</li>
<li>Transforming the data, such as taking the logarithm of the values, to make the outliers less extreme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In summary, outliers are observations that are significantly different from the other observations in a dataset. They can be caused by measurement error, data entry errors, or by the presence of rare and unusual events. There are several ways to identify and deal with outliers, depending on the context and the purpose of the analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overfitting-1">Overfitting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning and statistical modeling, where a model is trained too well on the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. It occurs when a model is too complex and has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data, and it learns the noise in the data rather than the underlying relationship.</li>
<li>Overfitting can be identified by comparing the performance of the model on the training data and the validation data. If the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the validation data, it is overfitting.</li>
<li>There are several techniques to prevent overfitting, such as:
<ul>
<li>Using simpler models with fewer parameters</li>
<li>Using techniques such as regularization, which adds a penalty term to the model&rsquo;s objective function to discourage large values of the parameters</li>
<li>Using techniques such as early stopping, which stops the training process before the model becomes too complex</li>
<li>Using techniques such as cross-validation, which divides the data into multiple subsets and trains and evaluates the model multiple times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In summary, overfitting is a common problem in machine learning and statistical modeling where a model is trained too well on the training data and performs poorly on new unseen data.

<h3 id="parameter">Parameter</h3>
<ul>
<li>In mathematics and statistics, a parameter is a value that describes a characteristic of a population or a probability distribution. Parameters are typically unknown and must be estimated from sample data using statistical methods.</li>
<li>There are two types of parameters:</li>
<li>Fixed parameters: These are parameters that are constant and do not change with the sample size.</li>
<li>Random parameters: These are parameters that vary with the sample size, they are treated as random variables.
<ul>
<li>There are different types of parameters depending on the model or the analysis:</li>
<li>In probability distributions, parameters are used to describe the shape or the behavior of the distribution, such as the mean, standard deviation, and probability of success in a binomial distribution.</li>
<li>In statistical models, parameters are used to describe the relationship between the variables, such as the slope and intercept in a linear regression model.</li>
<li>In machine learning, parameters are the values that are learned from the data during the training process, such as the weights and biases in a neural network.</li>

<h3 id="perturbation">Perturbation</h3>
<ul>
<li>In mathematics, physics and engineering, perturbation theory is a method used to analyze and make approximations for systems that are similar to but slightly different from a known system. It is used to study the behavior of a system when small changes are made to its parameters, such as the strength of a force or the value of a constant. The goal of perturbation theory is to find an approximate solution to a problem that is easier to solve than the original problem, while still retaining enough accuracy to be useful.</li>
<li>There are two main types of perturbation methods:
<ul>
<li>Regular perturbation: This is used when the small parameter is in the problem&rsquo;s equation, and it is used to find an approximate solution in a series of terms of increasing powers of the small parameter.</li>
<li>Singular perturbation: This is used when the small parameter is in the problem&rsquo;s boundary conditions, and it is used to find an approximate solution in a &ldquo;fast&rdquo; variable and a &ldquo;slow&rdquo; variable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perturbation theory has many applications in physics, engineering and mathematics. It is used in Quantum mechanics, Celestial mechanics, fluid dynamics and control theory, among other fields.</li>

<h3 id="prediction">Prediction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prediction is the process of using data, models, and knowledge to make forecasts or estimates about future events or outcomes. In the context of machine learning, prediction refers to the task of using a trained model to make predictions about new, unseen data. The goal of prediction is to use the information from the past to make informed decisions about the future.</li>
<li>There are different types of prediction, including:
<ul>
<li>Classification: This type of prediction is used when the outcome variable is categorical, such as predicting whether an email is spam or not.</li>
<li>Regression: This type of prediction is used when the outcome variable is continuous, such as predicting the price of a stock or the temperature tomorrow.</li>
<li>Time series forecasting: This type of prediction is used when the outcome variable is a function of time, such as predicting the number of sales in the next quarter or the weather forecast for tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prediction is used in many fields such as finance, medicine, weather forecasting, transportation and many more. The quality of a prediction is often measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the ROC curve.</li>
